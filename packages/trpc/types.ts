 *                        OR no runs ever AND the trigger was created
 *                        recently. The Setup or Translation agent owes
 *                        the user a next step.
 *   - **error**        — the most recent run errored. The user needs to
 *                        know.
 *   - **paused**       — explicit pause flag. Reserved for when we add
 *                        one; today nothing returns this.
 *
 * The thresholds below are intentionally generous; this is a triage
 * heuristic, not a SLA. Edge cases (a trigger that was live yesterday
 * but had a transient error this morning) fall into `error` — the
 * user surfaces the recent error and can investigate.
