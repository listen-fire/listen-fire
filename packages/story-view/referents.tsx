 * What a name in the script REFERS TO, said the way a person would say it.

 * `m`, `co`, `c.name` mean nothing to a reader — they are the author's private
 * shorthand. Every reference arrives here carrying what the checker knew it
 * stood for, and the only thing this file adds is the connective tissue: "the",
 * "'s", "it just created". Every NOUN comes from a label the owning system
 * declared, or from a word the author wrote themselves.
 *
 * Two honesty rules run through it.
 *
 *   NOTHING RESOLVED ⇒ NOTHING CLAIMED. A reference with no origin, or one
 *   whose type nobody named, is shown exactly as it was written. A phrase
 *   nobody could check is worse than the shorthand.
 *
 *   A PHRASE THAT FITS TWO THINGS NAMES NEITHER. Two bindings of the same kind
 *   against the same type compose the same sentence, so the projection flags
 *   the collision and the name goes back on — in parentheses, once.
