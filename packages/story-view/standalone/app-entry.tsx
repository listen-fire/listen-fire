/**
 * The IN-CHAT MOUNT — the same board, drawn inside the conversation.
 *
 * The third mount of one renderer: the workbench panel, the link page, and
 * this. It draws whatever story the host hands it and knows nothing else —
 * no fetching, no session, no second round trip, because the sandbox around
 * an app blocks every request it could make.
 *
 * TWO ARRIVALS, ONE WINNER. A fresh call's result rides the live
 * `ui/notifications/tool-result` push — the spec's one defined channel,
 * timed by real tool-execution latency, which is why the race below has
 * never shown up on a fresh call. Reopening a chat mounts this same view for
 * a call that already finished — no execution to wait through, no spec
 * provision for the replay either (`tool-result` is only "MUST send... if
 * the View is displayed during tool execution") — so a host answering that
 * gap may push the notification before this script's own listener exists
 * (unrecoverable: a message sent to nobody is gone), or fold it into the
 * `ui/initialize` reply instead (`HostContext.toolResult`, see `app-host`).
 * Either can arrive in either order, so the FIRST story wins and nothing
 * after it — a duplicate, a bare link body, whatever — changes the panel.
 *
 * DEGRADES TO THE LINK. If no story ever arrives — an older host, a result
 * whose metadata was genuinely dropped, an automation we couldn't read —
 * this shows the link the tool has always returned. Never a blank panel:
 * blank is the one outcome worse than the text-and-link we shipped before.
 *
