/**
 * The canvas: the automation's CONTROL FLOW, top to bottom — and, when the file
 * holds more than one story, a BOARD of those columns side by side.
 *
 * One spine in program order. Only the two exclusive forks get lanes — an
 * if/otherwise and a race — because side-by-side reads as "different things
 * happen"; a for-each is "the same thing, many times", so it gets a frame with
 * one way in and one way out. An ask cuts clean across the spine, because
 * everything below it genuinely waits.
 *
 * Nothing is measured off the DOM. Lanes are equal-width grid tracks, so a
 * fan's ends are known before layout: an SVG stretched across the same width
 * lands on the lane centres by construction, and stays there at any size. A
 * column's width comes from the same place — the shape of the story in it —
 * never from the pane, which is what would have squeezed a three-way branch
 * into the room a straight line needs. It comes from the CONTENT, too: a
 * column is as wide as the widest thing in it and no wider (see `sizing`).
 *
 * Honesty rule inherited from the design: an arm that STOPS THE RUN gets a
 * terminal cap and no line back to the spine. Termination is a PROJECTED fact
 * (`Step['terminates']`), computed once by the checker's own rule and carried
 * through the story — never re-derived here, which is how this stayed in sync
 * with the language instead of drifting the day it grows another terminator.

 * it, so a fork lower down could make an extraction three times the width of
 * the tree inside it and leave the tree marooned in its own rectangle. Hugging
 * is what a box around something means, and it is now what every frame does
 * rather than a flag one caller passed.
 *
 * Centring costs nothing and needs no measurement: the spine centres its
 * children, so a frame narrower than the spine sits on the spine, and what it
 * holds is centred within it — the two centres are the same line, at any width.
 * Everything on the spine sits this way now, the ask cut included (see `Bar`).
 *
 * The head is a SENTENCE, so it is laid out as running text. It used to be a
 * flex row, which made every run of words between two chips its own flex item
 * and spaced them apart — that is where "as set out below ." got its space
 * before the full stop. Chips are inline, and flow in a sentence unaided.
