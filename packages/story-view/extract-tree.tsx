/**
 * What an extraction is actually looking for — the WHOLE tree, not a summary.
 *
 * An extraction's shape is the most interesting thing about it: which things
 * are being found, what is being read off each one, and which of them hang off
 * which. A summary line ("looking for: company, person") threw away the two
 * facts a reader wants — the fields, and the nesting — so the tree is drawn as
 * a tree: one framed entity per node, its fields listed inside it, its own
 * entities nested within.
 *
 * Every word here except the connective tissue is the AUTHOR's: the entity
 * name, the field name, and the sentence they wrote to describe each. Nothing
 * is invented, and nothing is shortened.
