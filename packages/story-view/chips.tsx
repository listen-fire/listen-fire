/**
 * One authored value, inline.
 *
 * A value the author wrote is one of two things, and they read nothing alike.
 * A FIXED value ("Passed", 12) is code, and shows as code. A value assembled
 * out of references — a template, a bare name — is a SENTENCE, and shows as
 * one: the literal runs as plain words, the references as the things they refer
 * to. The split comes from the story, which split it at the AST; nothing here
 * scans a string for `${`.
 *
 * `unparsed` is shown as itself. An expression we could not read is not a
 * literal, and colouring it like one would be the page claiming a fact it does
 * not have.
 *
 * A value that is a STRING is drawn on ONE WELL, whatever it is made of. A
 * fixed string already was one — the quoted box on a write card is the look —
 * and a template is the same value written another way, so it gets the same
 * box: the literal runs and the references it splices in sit TOGETHER inside
 * it. Loose in the card they read as chips floating in a paragraph, with the
 * text between them ("… · from ", "Filed in <") looking like the card's own
 * words rather than like the author's.
