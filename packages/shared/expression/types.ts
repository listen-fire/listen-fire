// plan). Two grains, because the facts genuinely live at two grains:
//
//   • PER-PROPERTY (`FieldCapability`) — whether the SOURCE SYSTEM can filter /
//     order by THIS field server-side, and with which operators. A fact about
//     the field, known when the adapter describes the type that owns it.
//   • PER-EDGE (`EdgeCapability`) — whether filter / order / limit can be
//     PUSHED ACROSS this relationship at all, and HOW:
//       - 'native'  ⇒ pushed to the provider's query API; the offerable fields
//                     are the target's per-property capability (`FieldCapability`);
//       - 'bounded' ⇒ the adapter knows the edge yields a small set and runs the
//                     shared filter unit over it — so ANY target field is
//                     filterable/orderable with the shared unit's operators,
//                     regardless of per-property server-side support.
//
// The consumer (checker / engine) combines the two: for a `native` edge it
// offers the target's filterable properties; for a `bounded` edge it offers all
// of them. Absent ⇒ unknown ⇒ gating degrades to silent best-effort, exactly
// like schema today. Operators are FilterOperator (incl. WITHIN).

// a meaningful order, without anyone asking?". A Slack channel's messages are
// sequenced but their order is not pushable; an Attio company's people are
// order-pushable but carry no inherent sequence. The two are independent.
//
// This is what the set/list split reads: an edge with no declared sequencing
// yields a SET (order-sensitive folds refuse it), a sequenced edge yields a
// LIST. Absent ⇒ unordered, which is the safe default — an undeclared edge
// costs the author an explicit ORDER BY, a wrongly-declared one silently
// blesses a fold whose result is arbitrary.
//
// Declare it ONLY when the adapter's fetch path actually returns that order
// today (an explicit sort, an ORDER BY, or a provider call documented to
// return ordered results) — never because the domain sounds ordered.
