// The contracts the movement engine speaks, in one package an embedder
// imports without the run host: whose a run is (an opaque tenant id), the
// host's families and what each entry into the engine is handed, a parked
// flow's state, file descriptors, the adapter protocol, and what a module is
// written against: the adapter contract and its manifest, the catalog's schema
// types and positions, the Expression vocabulary, plugins as data and the
// model names. The catalog snapshot a run is handed is the language's
// (`movement-lang`), re-exported here. Runtime-neutral: what only a Node host
// has (a byte stream, the secrets family, the browser slot) is
// `@listen-fire/module-runtime`'s.
