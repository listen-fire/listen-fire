// The check every run on this engine passes before it executes: the
// language-version pin, the parse and the Rust checker (crates/movement-
// checker, in the movement artifact), throwing MOVENG_LANGUAGE_VERSION,
// MOVENG_PARSE or MOVENG_CHECK. A run is checked before its segment opens
// (`checkPinnedInRust`), then by the engine itself as the segment starts (its
// native check). The `check.program` host call (rust_host.ts), which only a
// segment started without the native check makes, is answered by the same
// checker as data (`checkAnswerInRust`): its diagnostics, the import link and
// the checker's stamps.
//
// The stamps are what the checker settles on nodes that the engine reads: on
// a write's spread the fields it stands for, on a graph's spread what it
// copies, on a graph entry whose value is a record that the entry is an edge
// holding it. Each is keyed by its node's place in the program's JSON — the
// AST path scheme:
//
//   path = a JSON Pointer (RFC 6901) from the Program object to the stamped
//          node, through the keys and array indices of the Program exactly
//          as the parser emits it: `/statements/2/body/0/write/spreads/1`.
//   file = absent for the program run; a library file's path for a stamp in
//          a file it imports (the same pointer, from that file's Program).
//
// A call nested in an expression (`FIRST(MAP(xs, (x) => …))`) continues the
// pointer through the slot it is written in: `<slot>/nested/<start>-<end>/value`
// is the right-hand side the call reads as, `start` and `end` its extent in
// the slot's text (UTF-16 offsets).
