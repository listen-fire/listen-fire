 * Public signature — surfaced through the registry. The editor uses
 * `additions.edges.vcUrl` to power downstream traversal autocomplete:
 * `(msg)-[urls:#transform { plugin: "vc-url-retrieval" }]->(:Url)` then
 * `urls.name / urls.url / urls.file / urls.text` resolves at extract
 * time.
 *
 * `params.text` is what the transform scans for URLs. One parameter, two ways
 * of being filled: inside a `through [ … ]` stage the engine populates it from
 * the extract source, so the author writes `through [vc_url_retrieval]` and
 * nothing else; called plainly there is no extraction to fill it, so the
 * caller writes `vc_url_retrieval(text: …)` themselves.
 *
 * `params.email` is author-supplied: the email to type into an
 * email-gated link (DocSend, a data room, …) if fetching one requires
 * it. No implicit guessing — a run with no email simply can't get past
 * a gate and that URL is skipped, not silently mistyped.
