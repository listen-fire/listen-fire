 * `listen to inbox { key: "dealflow" } fire dealflow_intake` — a file-level
 * statement declaring that events on a constructed adapter instance fire a
 * movement. Trigger rows are fully DERIVED from these (one per listen); a
 * file with no listens is a library. The config block is the trigger's
 * adapter-specific routing config (e.g. the email plus-address `key`) and
 * may be omitted.
 *
 * A system whose RECORDS change is listened to the same way — the knowledge
 * graph included, which is constructed and named like any other:
 *
 *   graph = kg()
 *   listen to graph { type: "Company", events: ["record.created", "record.updated"],
 *                     fields: [Domains] } fire on_company_change
 *
 * Every value here is a plain quoted one: `type` pins which record type is
 * watched, `events` names the uniform `record.*` change kinds, and `fields`
 * narrows updates to ones touching the named properties. What the listen
 * FIRES is the change, not the record — the fired movement's parameter is the
 * event position (`change: <graph-[:`Record Change` WHERE `type` ==
 * "Company"]->>`) and the record is one hop along its `Record` edge.
 *
 * `listen` is the ONLY invoker (the former `run` entry retired when time
 * and manual runs collapsed into adapters). Every channel is constructed
 * EXPLICITLY and named first, then listened to by name: scheduled work
 * constructs a cron instance (`timer = cron()`; `listen to timer { schedule:
 * "0 9 * * 1" } fire digest`), on-demand work a manual one (`go = manual()`;
 * `listen to go {} fire backfill` — "Run now" injects an event on that
 * channel). The fired movement's parameter is typed against the SAME named
 * instance (`go: <go-[:invocation]->>`).
 *
 * An inline construction — `listen to manual() {}` — still parses (the call
 * lands in `construct`) but the checker rejects it: an instance exists only
 * from an explicit `name = adapter()` construction (spec
 * `plans/2026-06-24-required-instantiation/0_spec.md`). `construct` is kept
 * on the node only so the checker can recognise that mistake and guide the
 * fix.
