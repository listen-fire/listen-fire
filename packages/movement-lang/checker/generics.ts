// A landing type that is GENERIC OVER ITS CONSTRUCTION SITE (asks-as-adapter
// layer 5, chunk B).
//
// Some edges promise a record whose shape the WRITE decides: an ask's
// `Response` lands an `Answer` typed by the very `Options` the ask offered, so
// `Choose` with `["Seed","Series A"]` answers an enum of those two, and nothing
// weaker is the truth. The TS analogue is a generic parameter inferred from an
// argument: `Response<T>` where `T` comes from the body.
//
// THE TYPE IS ITS DERIVATION. Two Choose asks offering the same options in the
// same order have the SAME response type, so the synthesized landing is keyed
// by an opaque token derived from (written type, edge, the authored literal
// values) — collisions are structural identity, not a hazard. The host derives
// the key when it registers the landing; the checker derives it when it looks
// one up; neither parses it. Exactly `refinementKey`'s contract, over a write
// body instead of a WHERE.
//
// The checker DECIDES nothing here: which body field parameterizes the landing
// is the adapter's own declaration (`EdgeSchema.genericOver`), and what the
// literals MEAN is the host's synthesis. The checker only agrees on a key.

 * the specialization is of the base type, so two edges specializing the same
 * base with the same values name ONE type — structural identity, the same rule
 * that makes `unionKey` collapse two spellings of `A | B`. The written record
 * type is deliberately absent: it is already what fixes the base target.
 *
 * `values` is in AUTHORED order, deliberately: the values become an enum's
 * option list, and `fieldTypeEquals` compares enum options positionally, so a
 * reordered list IS a different type. Sorting here would make two distinct
 * types share one key.
 *
 * The `'generic-landing'` tag is what stops it colliding with the other opaque
 * keys sharing the `positions` namespace (a refinement, a union, an event
 * address).
