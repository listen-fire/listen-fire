// An event address: what identifies it, and — separately — what it reads as.
//
// `movement intake(e: <at-[:`Record Change` WHERE `action` == "record.created" AND `base` == "appDevLoop" AND
// `table` == "tblDeals"]->>)` — a type annotation is an ADDRESS, and the
// signature names the FULL address.
//
// IDENTITY IS A KEY, NOT A NAME, and that separation is the whole file.
//
// The measured bug this closes is magic naming. `refinements.ts` fabricates
// `${typeName} "${selected}"` and then uses that one string as map key, as
// author-facing text, AND as a uniqueness claim — so two bases each holding a
// `Deals` produce one string, `graftPosition`'s `if (positions[name] !== undefined)
// return` reads it as "already grafted, reuse it", and base 2's descriptor is
// silently discarded. The same file already holds the honest counter-example:
// `refinementKey` is `JSON.stringify([type, canonical(expr)])` — an opaque token
// that is only ever COMPARED, never parsed, never displayed, and therefore
// cannot collide.
//
// The test is: is it PARSED, or only COMPARED? `CRM — Companies` was magic
// because `demandSeed` substring-matched it — the convention had to HOLD for the
// checker to work. So:
//
//   - `eventAddressKey` is the IDENTITY. Opaque. Derived identically by the
//     checker (resolving a signature) and the host (grafting the position it
//     names), which is what makes them unable to drift — the `refinementKey`
//     shape. NOTHING may parse it or depend on its internal structure.
//   - `eventAddressDisplay` is the DISPLAY. A separate string, carried on
//     `PositionSchema.displayName`, used only by diagnostics. It may collide,
//     be ambiguous, be re-worded — it means nothing to the machine.
//
// POSITION-PER-LISTEN FALLS OUT of this form, rather than being built. Identity
// IS the address, so two listens have two addresses → two keys → two positions,
// automatically. Nothing asks "which listen?" and there is no per-listen
// bookkeeping — exactly as `-[:Base WHERE `Name` == "CRM"]->` and `-[:Base WHERE
// `Name` == "Ops"]->` need no "per-base" mechanism. The current code needs one
// only BECAUSE a fabricated name collapses distinct addresses onto one string.
//
// Why an address is a MAP of pinned values and not the predicate it was written
// as: the two sides do not hold the same thing. A signature holds a WHERE; a
// listen holds `{ base: "appDevLoop", table: "tblDeals" }`. They agree on the
// values and nothing else, so the values are the address. That is what the
// adapter already declares with `ListenConfigKey.narrows` — the config key IS
// the hop — and why `describeRecordChange` publishes `base`/`table` as real
// event-node properties: the same values narrow both.
