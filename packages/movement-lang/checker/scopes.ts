// Lexical scope structure for the movement checker (M2).
//
// The checker walks the program once, in source order, maintaining a chain
// of `Scope`s. Each scope carries:
//   - `symbols`   — names bound so far (imports, assignments, params,
//                   hoisted movement/node declarations, traversal aliases,
//                   graph instances);
//   - `pending`   — names a *later* statement in the same statement list
//                   will bind (prescanned), so a read before the binding
//                   statement is reported as use-before-bind rather than
//                   unknown-name. TDZ-style: a pending name shadows an
//                   outer binding of the same name;
//   - `escaped`   — names that were bound inside an already-closed
//                   traversal block (out of scope, but remembered so the
//                   diagnostic can hint at the block's meta-node edge);
//   - `declarations` — every binding in source order, with the location it
//                   becomes the answer from. The checker never needs it (it
//                   asks where it stands); the editor does (it asks at a
//                   cursor), so it is kept only when recording.
//
// M2b layers type information onto `ScopeSymbol` (instance schemas via
// `Catalog.instantiate`, write-result handle shapes, narrowed positions)
// without changing the resolution mechanics here: `schema` for graph-like
// symbols (instances, shapes), `posType` for position-like
// symbols (params, aliases, handles, extract/block bindings), `movement`
// for lazy parameter typing at call sites.
