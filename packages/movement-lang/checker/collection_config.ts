// `MAP(xs, { … }, f)` / `FILTER(xs, { … }, f)` — the settings record a
// collection op may be given between its collection and its function. The
// language's convention for a function that takes options: the data first,
// then the settings, then the function (`fn(data…, settings, lambda)`).
//
// The checker and the engine both read the record through `readCollectionConfig`,
// so what was refused at save and what the run does cannot disagree.
//
// Every value is WRITTEN DOWN, never worked out. The record decides how the run
// is scheduled and what a failure does, and both are facts the checker has to
// see to refuse a nonsense one (`concurrency: 0`, `onError: "retry"`) — a
// computed value would move that refusal to the middle of a run. It is the same
// line TypeScript draws: an options object written in place is checked key by
// key (excess-property checking), which is exactly what this does.
