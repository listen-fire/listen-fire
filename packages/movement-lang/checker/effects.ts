// The EFFECT ROW — one inferred fact per function: what running it may do.
//
// A row answers "reads crm, writes slack, calls a model, waits" for a movement
// or a closure. For a body the checker can walk it is INFERRED, and there is no
// surface syntax for one. For a body it cannot — a plugin, an adapter's field
// function — it is DECLARED beside that function's arguments, and folded into a
// caller by the same `absorb`; that is what makes a plugin an ordinary function
// rather than a name legal in one syntactic slot. Consumers are the picture
// (where a run can pause), the plugin call gate, and — later — the
// cancellable-arm warning and dry-run.
//
// Two things the shape is deliberate about:
//
//   - `read` and `write` carry the SOURCE they touch, not a boolean. The
//     picture needs "writes to crm"; authority is already scoped per instance;
//     and a boolean would mean "touches something", which is the one-value-two-
//     facts smell. A source is an identity (`token`, compared by reference, so
//     it cannot collide) plus a display name. A constructed instance is one; so
//     is the synthetic source a DECLARED row names (`vc_url_retrieval` reads
//     the web, which is not one of the author's graphs).
//   - `partial` says the row is a LOWER BOUND: some site or callee did not
//     type, so what is listed is real but may not be all of it. Without it an
//     unresolved call would read as "does nothing", which is a claim the
//     checker has no business making.
//
// Inference is bottom-up over the call graph. There is no recursion in the
// language, so there is no fixpoint to find: a function's row is the union of
// its body's primitive effects and the rows of what it calls.
