// "Does this position carry everything that structure declares?" is asked in
// three places now, and it is the same question every time: a node literal
// reaching a declared parameter (wave 1), a call's value reaching one (layer
// 10 §A), and an `IS <Doc>` predicate (layer 10 §D). So the rule lives here,
// once, phrased over what a position OFFERS rather than over how it was
// minted — a synthesised landing and an adapter-backed one are compared by the
// same code because a type IS its structure, whoever made it.
//
// It is TypeScript's structural assignability, unchanged: every member the
// required side declares must be present and compatible; extra members are
// fine (the required side cannot see them).
