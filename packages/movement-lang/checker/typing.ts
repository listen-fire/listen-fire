// Typed positions for the movement checker (M2b).
//
// Layers schema types onto M2a's binding layer: every bound name MAY carry a
// `PositionTypeRef` (where one is derivable), and the typed checks — writes
// (check 2), traversal validity (check 4), linked writes (check 5),
// narrowing (check 6), call fit (check 7), effect typing (check 8),
// extraction-tree validity (check 9) — fire only where a type is KNOWN.
// Unknown stays silent: a missing catalog schema, an untyped alias, a
// `_resources` hop all degrade to "no diagnostics", never to false
// positives.
//
// `ExpressionTyping` is the one expression walker: it validates every
// traversal it can root (reporting unknown edges / extract-field misuse)
// while inferring a shallow value type for write-field compatibility. The
// statement-level integration (which symbols carry which types) lives in
// check.ts; this module knows schemas and expressions, not scopes.

// (`wideningUnder`) and nowhere else: a union exists only where this produced
// one, so no rule downstream asks the version again.
//
// The union is the READER's to build, because only a reader knows the
