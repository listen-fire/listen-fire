// Injectable catalog interface for the movement checker (M2).
//
// The movement-lang package stays pure: it never reads adapter manifests,
// credential stores, or plugin registries itself. The host (apps/api)
// implements `Catalog` from its real sources — adapter manifests
// (listEntryPoints / describeTypes), the workspace credential store, the
// transform-plugin registry — and injects it into `checkProgram`.
//
// M2a needed only the file-boundary facts (4_type_system.md "What the
// checker knows", check 1): which adapters / credentials / plugins exist,
// which named arguments a construction call accepts, which of those is the
// credential, and which adapter each credential authenticates. M2b adds the
// per-instance schema surface (`InstanceSchema`) that the typed checks —
// writes, linked writes, traversal validity, narrowing, call fit — resolve
// against. A host that cannot produce a schema returns `undefined` from
// `instantiate`; every schema-typed check stays silent for that instance.

   * fanout the whole plan exists to kill.
