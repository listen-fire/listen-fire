// Checker for the movement language.
// Spec: plans/2026-06-10-data-movement-language/4_type_system.md.
//
// M2a (binding layer): checks 1 (import/construction validity) and 3
// (bound-before-read & parallel sibling isolation) — plus the scoping
// model: file/movement/traversal/branch scopes, traversal-block bindings
// that do NOT escape (only the block's assigned meta-node does), traversal
// aliases scoped to their block body, movement/shape hoisting, calls, and
// `through`-argument phasing inside `extract` trees.
//
// M2b (schema-typed layer, built on checker/typing.ts): checks 2 (write
// root/field validity), 4 (traversal validity), 5 (linked writes), 6 (IS
// narrowing), 7 (call fit), 8 (effect typing: write handles, block
// meta-nodes), 9 (extraction-tree validity + explicit type annotations,
// primitive or BORROWED by dotted path, with write-target adoption
// demoted to an info-severity annotation suggestion). Types attach to
// ScopeSymbols where derivable —
// construction → instance schema, write → handle, extract → inferred
// result graph, block → meta-node, parameter → TypeRef resolution — and
// every typed check fires only where the type is KNOWN; unknown stays
// silent (no false positives from missing schemas).
//
// Diagnostics are COLLECTED, never thrown — the checker is the feedback
// surface of the agent's author → typecheck → repair loop, so it reports
// every problem it can find with the most precise span it has.
//
// Name references inside expression slots come from the expression bridge:
// each slot is read by `expressionOfSlot` / `conditionOfSlot` (a refusal
// becomes MOV_EXPR_PARSE), and the resulting formula
// AST is walked for the names that resolve against statement scope —
// `traverse.aliasRoot` / `alias_ref` nodes, plus slots that are exactly one
// bare identifier. Formula `property` references relative to the ambient
// position (backticked or nested bare names like `AI(prompt_binding)`) are
// NOT scope references and are deliberately not resolved here; ambient
// property validity is M2b's schema work.
