// The exact rewrite a diagnostic offers — the repair, not a description of it.
//
// An authoring agent that is handed the corrected text pastes it and is done;
// one handed a menu of options spends another validate round picking. So the
// commonest refusals carry a fix built from the author's OWN source (their
// expression, their names, the connection they actually have), said twice:
// as edits a tool can apply, and in the message, which is all an agent reading
// text sees. A fix is offered only when it is certain to be the repair — a
// rewrite that doesn't compile is worse than none.
