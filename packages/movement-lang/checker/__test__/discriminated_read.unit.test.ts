// Discriminated READS (plan layer 1b): a hop whose WHERE names the list —
// `` -[le:`List Entries` WHERE `listName` == "Master Deals List"]-> `` — is
// checked against THAT list's type, not against the union of every list. The
// read-side dual of the discriminated write, and the same mechanism as every
// other narrowing: the HOST resolves the selection and registers a refined
// position, the checker looks it up by key and decides nothing.
//
// What is NEW here is the second half — a name in the WHERE that the type it
// landed on does not declare is now the ordinary unknown-field error. Before,
// every bare name in a bracket WHERE typed silently, because a name there is
// either a field of the hop target or a binding in scope and a pure lookup
// cannot tell a binding from a typo. Asking scope for mere presence separates
// them.
//
// TWO shapes so a hardcode cannot pass (movement-lang/CLAUDE.md's second-shape
// rule): `crm`'s list entries (discriminant `listName`, list-scoped fields) and
// `helpdesk`'s tickets (discriminant `queue`, different fields, different
// member names).
