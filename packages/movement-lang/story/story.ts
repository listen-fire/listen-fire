// The STORY IR — a checked program, projected into something a renderer can
// draw without knowing the language.
//
// Two rules shape everything here.
//
//   1. FULLY SERIALIZABLE. The checker's recording is made of LIVE objects:
//      `Scope`s with parent pointers, instance tokens whose identity is object
//      reference. None of that survives a wire. This pass is where identity
//      becomes a stable id — a binding's name plus the source position it was
//      declared at — so `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(story))` loses nothing.
//
//   2. ADAPTER-BLIND. Adapter types, event names, narrowing keys, record types
//      and edge names travel through as OPAQUE DECLARED STRINGS. Nothing here
//      parses one, and nothing here branches on one. The display vocabulary
//      that turns `attio` + `company` into "a Company in Attio" is an adapter
//      contribution resolved downstream, never a table in the core.
//
// It reads the recording for what the CHECKER resolved and the AST for what the
// AUTHOR wrote — order, nesting, and the verbatim text of every expression.
