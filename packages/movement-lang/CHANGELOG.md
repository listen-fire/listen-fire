# @listen-fire/movement-lang

## 0.14.1

No changes in this release.

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 0.14.0, a new compatibility key: a field is never read through a value that may be missing (`?.`), a walk off a union lands on one of its members (`is` narrows it), `lazy` and the loop guard slot are retired. See docs/language/migrating-to-0.14.md.

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 83543ba: `connect` names the adapter and the credential itself (``gh = connect `@lf/github` using my_github``, `crm = connect #acme_crm using acme` for a module that is no package), with no `import … from adapters` or `from credentials`; the import form is deprecated and still checks under a `0.13` pin. The wasm checks the new form; the handbook, the modules' examples and the authoring MCP's guidance show only it, and the handbook's programs listen to the `manual` and `cron` units by name rather than connecting them.
  
  `@listen-fire/embed`: a module the host registers from a package (`modules: [{ module: slackModule, package: "@lf/slack" }]`) is connected by that package's name, as on every host; the host's own modules are connected as `#` and their adapter type.

## 0.12.13

### Patch Changes

- The command is now `listen-fire`, no longer `lf`: every message, hint, description and handbook page that tells someone what to run names `listen-fire` (for example `listen-fire connect s3_files`, `listen-fire credential add --module webhook <name>`). Module names (`@lf/…`), `lf.yaml`, `.lf/` and `LF_*` variables are unchanged.

## 0.12.6

### Patch Changes

- Adapter protocol 2.N: a module states the protocol minor it uses (`protocolMinor` on its manifest), and lf and the engine speak 2.0–2.2 and refuse a module outside that range by name. lf checks a slot module's protocol at start, so a slot module must answer `manifest` before anything else.
