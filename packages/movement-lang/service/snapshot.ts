// Serializable catalog snapshot — the checker `Catalog` as plain data.
//
// The checker's `Catalog` is an interface of lookups plus a synchronous
// `instantiate`; everything network-backed (adapter introspection, the
// credential store, the team ontology) happens while ASSEMBLING it. A
// snapshot captures the assembled result as JSON-safe data so it can cross
// the wire once and the browser can parse/check/complete offline.
//
// Two consumers:
//   - apps/api builds a snapshot per team (movement/catalog.ts) and serves
//     it over tRPC;
//   - the editor (and these language-service functions) rebuild a `Catalog`
//     from it via `fromCatalogSnapshot`.
//
// The snapshot is ALSO the enumeration surface completions need: the
// checker only ever asks "does X exist?", but autocomplete must list what
// exists — adapters, credentials, plugins, per-instance schemas.
