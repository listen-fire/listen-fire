// Positional analysis for the language service.
//
// The checker validates a whole program; an editor asks questions AT a
// position: which names are in scope here, what type does this one have,
// which write body am I inside? There is ONE typing walk — the checker's —
// and it RECORDS its scope frames and write regions when asked
// (`recordAnalysis`). This module is the cursor half: offsets ↔ locations,
// the frame/symbol/write lookups over that recording, and the editing
// tolerance a half-typed buffer needs.
//
// Editing states rarely parse — the statement being typed is incomplete —
// so `analyze` retries with the cursor's line blanked before giving up.
// The rest of the file is usually well-formed, which is exactly the scope
// information completions need.
