# Working on the language

Read this before changing the parser, the checker, or the type model.

They are not slogans. They have **repeatedly turned a feature into a deletion**,
and the times we skipped them we built a mechanism we then had to withdraw.

## Why — the evidence

From one day on `plans/2026-07-10-adapter-entry-positions` (2026-07-16/17), every
one of these came from taking the model *more* seriously, not less:

| we nearly built | asking the questions gave |
|---|---|
| extend `decidableEquality` to conjunctions | **deleted it** — narrowing evaluates a predicate; any shape composes free |
| re-key `refinementKey` over a set of (field, value) pairs | the triple **dropped out** of the design |
| a "union on the record edge" for two disagreeing listens | **withdrawn** — a listen must match the movement's signature; nothing to build |
| per-listen bookkeeping | **fell out** — identity IS the address, so two listens are two positions |
| keep the dotted type marker as an alias | **retired** — `.` is for properties, `-[:…]->` is for edges |

The things that *grew* were the hedges. 2026-07-17:

## What the questions mean in practice

### Structural, not nominal
A type IS its structure — its derivation — never a fabricated name. **Magic
naming is nominal typing smuggled into a structural system, and it always
surfaces as a collision.** `Table "Deals"` (two bases collide, second silently
discarded) and `` `CRM — Companies` `` (had to be substring-parsed) are the same
mistake. Identity = the ADDRESS; display is a separate field.

> **The test: is it PARSED, or only COMPARED?**
> Compared-only ⇒ an identity. Parsed ⇒ magic, and it will drift.

`refinementKey` is the honest shape: an opaque token both sides derive, so they
cannot disagree.

### Predictable means it TELLS you
**Silent degradation is the absence of a guarantee, not a weaker one.** This
language's entire recurring bug class is "the type system said nothing":
`readable: true` unchecked; a listen's param type never compared; a narrowing
collision discarded; two listens comparing equal; an undescribed position
accepting any field. Treat "degrades to silence" as suspect **even where a plan
sanctions it** — several such rules have since been retired as bugs.

Watch for one value meaning two facts. "I haven't looked" and "anything goes"
are different; so are "unnarrowed" and "narrowed to nothing".

### Reach for the TS analogue — it usually dissolves the question
- a listen matching a movement = **parameter vs argument**. `f(x: int)` and
  `f(3)` both "say int"; that is type checking, not duplication.
- event action variants + their union = a **discriminated union**; `IS` = a
  **type guard**.
- a narrowing that matches nothing = **`never`** — the correct type, not a
  failure. Don't error at the narrow; error when the handle is USED.
- a typo'd literal against a known value set = an **enum** error with a
  did-you-mean (`MOV_ENUM_UNKNOWN_VALUE`), not a downstream read error.

If a design question feels novel, check whether TS already answered it.

### Be right, then break
*"If this is right then I'm happy for it to be a breaking change that I fix
up in everyone's movements."* Weighing churn against correctness is weighing the
wrong thing. Never leave a conflation in place to avoid updating fixtures.

## Before you build a mechanism

**Search first.** Three times in one day the answer was already in the tree and
we nearly rebuilt it:

- `@listen-fire/shared/expression/filter.ts` — the shared predicate evaluator
  (`evaluatePredicate` / `isPurePredicate`) already handled conjunctions;
- `MOV_ENUM_UNKNOWN_VALUE` already did typo-with-did-you-mean, and simply never
  reached the event node;
- `getRecordForEvent` (Attio) was already the event→record edge the model
  wanted.

## Local gotchas

- **movement-lang's own jest is broken locally** (stale pnpm symlinks under
  `node_modules/jest` and `node_modules/ts-jest` point at `.pnpm` hashes that
  no longer exist). Run tests with `pnpm --filter movement-lang test` — the
  `test` script and the checked-in `jest.config.borrowed.cjs` borrow `apps/api`'s
  ts-jest install and jest binary instead of requiring a local reinstall.
  Expect ~60 suites / ~1770 tests green.
- **Never `pnpm build` this package in place** — the `.js` emit shadows the `.ts`
  and everything gets weird. Delete artifacts if it happens.
- A test fixture that matches one adapter's shape **cannot tell derived from
  hardcoded** — that is how a hardcoded Attio example survived in a diagnostic.
  Use a second shape.
- Diagnostics carry **no explicit severity** for errors — a test filtering
  `severity === 'error'` passes vacuously.

## The model

`plans/2026-07-10-adapter-entry-positions/` is the current authority on
type-space: describe is a walk (`2_type_space.md`), narrowing is traversal
(`4_polymorphic_edges.md`), **the path is the address** (`5_paths_as_addresses.md`),
promises belong to EDGES not nodes (`7_readable_means_readable.md`), and an event
is a meta edge you cannot traverse (`8_event_edges.md`). Later layers supersede
earlier ones; several sections are explicitly retracted — read to the end before
building.
