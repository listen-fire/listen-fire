// and every layer (parser, checker, engine, plugins, adapters) honours that pin
// by a conditional at the point of difference:
//
//     if (before(ctx.languageVersion, 2)) { …the old behaviour… }
//
// The integer is the identity — code compares it and never parses the name.
// The name is display only: it is what a person sees.
//
// A version keeps its row here after it leaves SUPPORTED, so a movement pinned
// to it can still be refused by name.
//
