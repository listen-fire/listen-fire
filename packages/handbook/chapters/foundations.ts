### what-an-automation-is

An automation is a small program (plain text, a \`.mvt\` file — the text is
canonical: everything the platform runs is derived from it on save). It runs
when an event reaches it — an inbound email, a changed record in a CRM, a new
row in a spreadsheet — and that event is a **position**: a point in the graph
of whichever system it came from.

Every system an automation touches is a graph — nodes joined by edges — so one
language works over all of them. From the position the event hands you, an
automation traverses to related positions, fans out across them, and reaches
into other systems' graphs, moving data between them. Almost everything else in
this handbook is a *consequence* of this, not a separate rule to memorise: when
something reads like a special case, look for the position and the edge.

### language-versions

An automation is pinned to the language release its text was written against,
a version such as \`0.12.0\`. The automation validates, saves and runs under that
pin, and an edit never changes it; a new automation is pinned to the current
release. So check an edit to an existing automation under the release it is
pinned to, not the current one.

A release reads a pin that has its own compatibility key (the minor while the
version starts with 0, so \`0.12.0\` and \`0.12.3\` read alike; the major from 1.0)
and refuses any other by name:

- a pin newer than the engine is refused; upgrade the engine
- a pin of an older key is refused; validate the text under the current release,
  then upgrade it

An \`lf\` project pins in \`lf.yaml\`'s \`engine:\` (\`lf init\` writes the current
release; \`lf upgrade\` moves it). An embedder pins with the run input's
\`languageVersion\`; absent means the engine's own release.

A warning on an automation says something keeps it on an older release: the
current release reports errors for its text, or marks a construct whose meaning
differs between the two releases, which blocks the move as surely as an error.
Other warnings, such as cost notes, never block. The automation keeps running as
it always has.

To upgrade one, repair what the current release reports — in text that still
validates under the older pin — then upgrade it: the check runs again, shows
what it finds, and moves the automation only when that is clean and the move is
confirmed. Only an upgrade someone requests moves an automation; a new release
never does.

### the-cardinal-rule

Inbound data is rarely loose facts — it is several things that belong together:
a company, the people it introduces, the deal that connects them. So the
cardinal rule: **when records belong together, write them along their edges** —
a linked write off the parent's handle, or \`link\` to a record that already
exists:

\`\`\`
parent = write crm-[:Companies]-> {
  unique by (Name)
  Name: msg.Subject
}

write parent-[:People]-> {
  unique by (Email)
  Email: contact.email
}
\`\`\`

Never write a related record as a flat, unconnected row and hope the connection
happens by itself; it does not. Before calling an automation done, check every
record it writes ends the run attached to the records it belongs with.

### match-a-known-pattern-first

Some situations carry hard-won wording — especially the scoping language that
keeps an extraction from grabbing the wrong entities ("only the record the
message is *about*, not the ones it merely mentions"). When a brief matches a
situation the \`use-cases\` chapter covers, read it first and lift its wording
rather than re-deriving it.

### factor-variants-dont-copy

Don't copy an automation and tweak it when a new input variant needs handling.
Factor the common steps into an automation each variant calls, handing it a
\`graph<Shape> { … }\` built from whatever that variant holds (anatomy's
composition section). Two near-identical automations are a smell.

### conventions

These hold everywhere, in every chapter, and are not restated per situation:

- No magic values: every adapter, credential, and plugin name is imported;
  every other name is bound by assignment or received as a parameter.
- Everything happens on a connected instance: parameter types, traversal
  roots, writes, and listens all name an instance you connected
  (\`crm = connect attio using acme\`) — never a bare adapter type.
- Types always wear angle brackets (\`m: <inbox-[:Email]->>\`, \`amount: <number>\`,
  \`rec is <crm-[:companies]->>\`); positions, values, and handles never do.
  Inside a type, \`-[:…]->\` names the edge the type sits behind; \`.\` is only
  ever property access (\`msg.Subject\`, and the field tail of a borrowed
  type: \`<crm-[:companies]->.funding_stage>\`).
- Declare functions with \`function\`. Calls pass arguments by position, in the
  order the callee declares them (\`\`Log Lead\`(msg)\`), as TypeScript calls a
  function, with an optional settings record last
  (\`map(xs, (x) => x.Name, { concurrency: 2 })\`). A plugin is called the
  same way (\`fetchUrl(c.website)\`, \`fetchUrl(u, { email: @user_email })\`). A function, a plugin, a built-in and a
  closure bound to a name are all called the same way. Names are exact in
  case outside walk brackets. Braces are declarative bodies.
- Fields read with a dot (\`msg.Subject\`); "double quotes" are strings;
  \${…} interpolates into them; == compares, = binds.
- Outside walk brackets the code reads like TypeScript (\`&&\`, \`||\`, \`!\`,
  \`c ? a : b\`, \`if (…) { … }\`, \`true\`, \`false\`, \`null\`). Inside
  \`-[…]->\` it reads like SQL (\`WHERE\`, \`AND\`, \`ORDER BY\`), and a field is
  read through the alias (\`c.Name\`).
- Built-ins are always there: core words in lower case (\`map\`, \`filter\`,
  \`count\`, \`first\`, \`coalesce\`, \`ai\`, \`fail\`) and namespaces in PascalCase
  (\`Text.trim\`, \`Number.round\`, \`Date.today\`, \`List.sum\`). Only adapters,
  plugins and credentials are imported.
- Backticks wrap any name that isn't a bare identifier: a field with spaces
  (\`msg.\`Sender Name\`\`), a credential's saved name
  (\`connect attio using \`Acme Prod\`\`), an automation's own name
  (\`function \`Unsnooze Actions\`(…)\`). Coin names the way the team already says
  them — \`Name: \`Subject Line\`\`, not \`Name: subject_line\` — so the brief, the
  page and the channel use the same words. Short instance names (\`crm = …\`)
  stay bare.
- \`node\` declares a shape; \`graph<Shape> { … }\` builds a record;
  \`extract(content, Shape, settings)\` extracts. Short closures take an
  expression body: \`(c) => c.name\`.
- Real names only: type, field, credential, and plugin names come from the
  live workspace catalog, never from memory or examples.
- Statements run in source order; a handle must be written before it is read.
- Entity-like targets carry \`unique by\` so repeats update instead of duplicate.

entry there is a fetchable \`chapter#section\`.`,
