// For test files only: the catalog every example the handbook shows is checked
// against, and the check itself — the one a run on the Rust engine passes
// before it executes (the pin, the parse, the Rust checker). The handbook's own
// tests hold its chapters, its front page and the search's control forms to
// it; a host holds the sections it adds (`system:*`, `plugin:*`) to the same
// catalog and the same check.
//
// THE FIXTURE IS CAPTURED FROM THE REAL ADAPTERS, NOT HAND-WRITTEN.
// `__test__/adapter_schemas.fixture.json` is the live output of the real
// catalog projection for the dev-loop workspace (the procedure is in the
// platform's docs/dev-loop.md, "Regenerating the handbook's adapter schema
// snapshot"). A hand-written fixture validates an example against a shape
// someone imagined: the previous one declared `Companies -[:People]-> People`,
// an edge REAL Attio does not have, so an example could pass and still be
// untrue. Captured schemas make "passes the test" and "true about the adapter"
// the same statement.
//
// The capture is driven FROM the handbook's probes (`--handbook`), through the
// very catalog build a save performs, so what gets described is what the
// examples demand: the fixture is the union of what the examples demand, and an
// example that names something no example demands is one it cannot back.
