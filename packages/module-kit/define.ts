// A module: one integration, written once, loaded by every host. An adapter
// module is a system a movement reads and writes (`@lf/dealroom`); a plugin
// module is a set of functions a movement calls (`@lf/web`). Either one is its
// declarations (data the host acts on without knowing the module) and
// `create(ctx)`, which builds the methods over a context the HOST supplies:
// the credential, fetch, a logger, files, a key-value store and its config.
// Nothing in a module reaches the hosted product, a database or the recording
// layer; the host behind `ctx` is the only way out.
//
// The declarations are the adapter protocol's own (engine-contracts): what a
// module declares in process is exactly what its `manifest` answers over the
// wire, so the two transports cannot disagree about it.
