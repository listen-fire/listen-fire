// `@lf/email`: inbound email as a module. Mail reaches a movement through an
// inbound address (`<local>+<key>@<domain>`, `address.ts`) at whichever
// provider the deployment receives with — Mailgun or Resend — and every email
// has the same fields, edges and attachments whichever carried it.
//
// The module is everything about the mail itself: the adapter, each
// provider's wire shape and signature (`inbound/`), fetching what Resend's
// notification leaves out (`resend_inbound.ts`), a stored attachment's bytes
// (`providers.ts`) and the senders (`send/`). The host keeps what is about
// its own people: whose team a believed message is for and which trigger
// answers (an `InboundMailRouter` it hands the doors), the doors' routes, and
// any record of what it sent.
//
// The host hands the module the provider keys as the install's credential
// (`credential.ts`): the platform from its environment, listen-fire from the user's own
// Resend or Mailgun account.
