// The inbound address an email trigger listens on, declared as config blocks
// (the forwarding-address UI organically replicated as data — no bespoke
// component). A `section` frames it in plain prose; a `slug` block collects
// the variable part of `<local>+<key>@<domain>` while the prefix/suffix show
// the whole address live in the input chrome. `config.key` is the plus-suffix
// the inbound handler matches against (`routingKey: true` declares it
// generically, so no named "forwarding-address" concept lives in the engine).
// Editable from the automation detail page; unique across the team's email
// triggers (the engine enforces it on write). `destination` and other
// structural keys live in config too but are derived from the orchestration,
// not user-edited.
//
// The prefix and suffix come from the deployment's own address (`address.ts`),
// not from a constant: they used to spell one hardcoded inbox, which told
// every other deployment's authors to forward their mail there. A deployment
// with no
// address configured still shows the block — the key is real and it is what a
// routed message will be matched on — but says nothing about where to send
// mail, because it does not know.
