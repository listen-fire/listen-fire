# Changelog

Every pull request that changes what an operator sets or an author writes adds a line under Unreleased in the same pull request. Tagging a release moves the Unreleased entries under a heading for the new version, with the date.

Entries are written for two readers: an operator running a self-hosted installation (what to set, what a deploy applies, what behaves differently) and an author writing automations in the movement language (new or changed constructs, plugins, adapters, handbook idioms). The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions are the git tags described in [`deploy/UPGRADING.md`](deploy/UPGRADING.md).

## [v0.8.0] - 2026-09-29

Language versions arrive. Every automation is pinned to the language version it was written against and keeps that behaviour on every later release; a breaking change is delivered behind a version conditional and reaches an automation only when it is upgraded. Version 1 is **Quiet Heron**, the language as of v0.6.0. Version 2 is **Bright Otter**, the language as of v0.7.0 and after. Every automation saved before this release is pinned to Quiet Heron, so the v0.7.0 breaking changes below no longer apply to it until it is upgraded.

### Added

- Each automation carries a language version (name and number). `listAutomations` / `getAutomation` return `languageVersion`, `checkedAgainst` and, when an upgrade would not be clean, `upgradeDiagnostics`. The automations list shows the version with a **Review** badge when there is something to look at; the automation page lists the diagnostics.
- The deploy check: on every release the `migrate` step (Render: the pre-deploy command) re-validates every automation under its own version, then under the current one. A clean result moves the automation forward; anything else keeps it where it is and records why. `up.sh` prints the summary (advanced / to review / refused, by name); `pnpm deploy:check --summary` prints it again.
- `upgradeAutomation { automation, acknowledge }` (MCP): validates under the current version, returns the diagnostics, and moves the pin only on an acknowledged clean result. The editor and `validateAutomation` check a saved automation under its own version.
- An automation on a version a release no longer supports is refused to run, loudly, and named in the summary; on a deprecated version it runs with a warning.
- A `system` adapter, the platform as a system: `listen to sys { events: ["Run Failed"] }` fires when an automation's run fails; `Validation Issue`, `Deprecated Version` and `Release Applied` fire from the deploy check. Records carry the automation, the run, the version, the reason and a link; an automation never receives its own failure.
- A version-1 conformance corpus: the v0.6.0 test suites run against the current code under Quiet Heron (`pnpm --filter movement-lang test:conformance:v1`, `pnpm test:conformance:v1` in apps/api). Removing a version is deleting its conditionals and its corpus.
- Under an upgrade check only, two new warnings mark constructs whose meaning changed between versions: a direct plugin call whose output changed shape, and a `unique by` key that may be empty text.
- The agent dev loop (`pnpm dev:loop:agent`) runs its own Postgres and Redis (project `listen-fire-dev-agent`, ports 9434 and 6381) so it coexists with another stack on the shared ports.

### Changed

- The v0.7.0 breaking changes are now conditional on Bright Otter. Why each was made: `vc_url_retrieval` as a list — one string of all pages hid which page a fact came from, and a list lets `FIRST` and `_resources` keep the file; extracted text always present — every description already promised "empty otherwise", and `COALESCE` on every read was the cost of the type disagreeing; null tests on extracted text refused — with text always present they were always true, a silent bug; annotation required into typed fields — an unannotated field asks the model for words, and a number field given words failed at the adapter instead of at save; unknown type names refused — a typo silently became text with no option set; empty key is no key — an empty name matched every other empty name, merging unrelated records.


## [v0.7.0] - 2026-09-28

### Breaking

- `vc_url_retrieval` called on its own returns a list of records, one per fetched link (`name`, `url`, `file`, `text`), instead of one string of all the page text. Hold one first, then read its fields: `deck = FIRST(linked)`, then `deck.text`.
- A null test (`EXISTS`, `ISNULL`, `== null`, `!= null`) on an extracted text field is refused. Extracted text is always present — `""` when nothing was found — so test emptiness with `!= ""` instead.
- An extracted field written into a `number`, `date`, `boolean` or file field is refused until the field is annotated with that type.
- An unknown type name on a declared node's field is refused; it used to read silently as text.
- An empty `unique by` key component is treated as no key, and never matches.

### Added

- `match`: finds a record by identity without writing it. Same body and targets as `write` (`unique by` clauses plus asserted fields). A hit binds the record; a miss ends the enclosing scope quietly; used unbound it is a gate.
- `link` takes a match body as sugar for `match` then `link`; a body with no `unique by` identifies by all its fields.
- `FUZZY` is declared per field. The checker refuses `FUZZY` on a field the target does not list, and names the fields it does.
- Valuations Legal Entity resolves `unique by` by identity, with fuzzy matching on Name, Legal Name, Also Known As and Other Names.
- Files a `through` plugin fetched land on the extracted record's `_resources`, so the usual attach pattern puts them on any record with a file field.
- A record held in a variable (`deck = FIRST(pages)`) reads by field.
- `labels` listen option on a Gmail listener (default `["INBOX"]`) watches labels beyond the inbox, e.g. `["INBOX", "SPAM"]`.
- A node declaration can describe itself, each field and each nested node, and an extraction reuses it with `node entry: <Entry>` instead of repeating the shape inline.
- A write body can spread a record with `...e` / `?...e` — an extracted record, a declared parameter, or a record built in memory — writing each of its fields as a plain line.
- A dict literal is typed by its keys: `AT(d, "k")` on a key the literal wrote down reads that key's own type, present; an unknown key is refused with a did-you-mean.
- `AT(list, n)` reads a list by position. Like `FIRST`, it needs an ordered list and may miss.
- A `MAP` closure may run with no `return`, for its writes alone; a bare `MAP(...)` (and `FILTER`/`REDUCE`/`GROUPBY`/`KEYBY`) can run as a statement with no binding.
- `URL.HOST(text)` reads the lowercased host out of a link.
- Unary minus (`-x`) in formulas.
- A guard (`EXISTS(x.f)`, `x.f != null`, `NOT ISNULL(x.f)`) narrows a typed extracted field to present inside its arm.
- A field refused on a narrowable type (a hop landing on more than one member of a polymorphic type) names the narrowing test that admits it.
- The editor tints strings, so a multi-line prompt reads as text.

### Changed

- The handbook looks a single record up with `ONLY` and a guard (`x = ONLY(…)` then `if x == null { ERROR("…") }`) wherever one record is expected; a nested hop is for fanning out over many. Examples across the chapters and adapter sections follow it.
- The Bright Data SERP provider waits up to 90 s per request and retries a 429, a 5xx (including one reported only in `x-brd-status-code`), a timeout or an empty body, up to three attempts.
- A refusal from Google Custom Search is logged with its reason and fails the search, instead of reading as "no results".
- Website identity ignores scheme, `www.`, trailing slash and case.
- A Gmail poll reads every history page and holds an arrival the search has not indexed yet for 15 minutes, instead of dropping it.
- An imported declaration's refinements resolve in the library that declared it, instead of the importing file's own types.

### Fixed

- A PDF reached through a link is read from its own text layer before OCR, and is kept (with empty text and a warning) when no text can be read; it was sent straight to OCR and dropped when OCR was not configured. Any fetched document with no readable text is now kept rather than discarded.
- A write whose identity candidates were filtered could bind or update the wrong record.
- A valuations write with `unique by` created a new row every time instead of finding the existing one.
- `?:` on a valuations record now sees an existing value; a create no longer sends explicit nulls.
- An awaited `WHERE` stops at its first false condition, instead of reading every field it names off a candidate that already failed an earlier one.
- An extracted text field that finds nothing arrives as `""` instead of absent.

### Operator notes

- A deploy applies migration `20260928_123442_legal_entity_name_trigram.sql` (trigram indexes on legal entity names).
- Google has closed the Custom Search JSON API to new customers. New installations should set `WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=brightdata` with `BRIGHT_DATA_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `BRIGHT_DATA_SERP_ZONE`.

## [v0.6.2] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- Each run shows its model cost in the run history and the run detail, and on the MCP tools `listRuns`, `checkRun` and `inspectRun`.

## [v0.6.1] - 2026-09-25

### Changed

- `up.sh` refuses to start when the image store's disk has too little free space (`--no-space-check` skips this), and prunes older images after a healthy start, keeping one rollback tag in `LISTEN_FIRE_PREVIOUS_VERSION` (`--keep-images` skips this).
- The boot warning about a missing model key follows `MODEL_MAP`, so a deployment served entirely through a mapped provider is no longer warned.

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-09-25

### Breaking

- `MODEL_MAP` replaces `MODEL_ROUTE`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_ROUTE`, `OPENAI_MODEL_ROUTE` and `KNOWLEDGE_AGENT_PROVIDER`, which are no longer read. The map is a JSON object from a model name the product uses to `provider/wire-model`, with provider `anthropic`, `vertex`, `openai` or `gemini`. A deployment that set `MODEL_ROUTE=google` needs one of the Google maps in [`deploy/SELF_HOSTING.md`](deploy/SELF_HOSTING.md) before upgrading. Boot refuses a map it cannot serve.
- With no map set, the system, movement and ontology agents run on Claude (`claude-sonnet-5`) instead of GPT. Map `claude-sonnet-5` to `openai/gpt-5` to keep them on GPT.
- Image generation uses `gpt-image-1` on OpenAI (DALL-E 3 was shut down). Map `gpt-image-1` to a Gemini image model to keep Gemini images; a map naming `dall-e-3` is refused.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` alone no longer powers the agents; every chat call names a Claude model, so it needs a map sending those names to `openai`.
- A team's own model key is no longer used; every call uses the deployment's credentials.

### Added

- Gemini as a native chat provider, and transcription, embeddings and image generation routed through the same map.
- Research running on `openai` or `gemini` answers its searches through the deployment's own web search service.
- `GEMINI_BASE_URL` points Gemini calls at a stand-in service, for testing.
- Prices for Fable 5.1, Opus 4.6, undated Haiku 4.5 and `gpt-image-1`.

### Fixed

- Sonnet 5 is priced at $2/$10 per million tokens; dated Haiku 4.5 is priced as Haiku 4.5.
- Gemini image generation is addressed in `GOOGLE_MODEL_REGION`, not the OCR location.

### Operator notes

- A deploy applies migration `20260924_212525_llm_usage_preferred_model.sql`. Usage rows name the provider that served each call, the wire model, and the model name the product asked for.
- Moving an embedding model to another vendor means re-embedding stored vectors; boot refuses an embedding model narrower than its column.

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- A Gmail mailbox is connected by signing in as it. `GMAIL_CONNECT_METHOD` is `oauth` (the default) or `delegated`. The sign-in uses the Sheets and Drive OAuth client unless `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are set.
- The Gmail connect form also accepts a pasted refresh token.
- `GMAIL_SEND_ENABLED=true` makes the sign-in ask for the send scope; without it, a signed-in mailbox is read-only.
- A team manages its own members from settings: grant and revoke access, add people directly, create service accounts, and edit the team's name, email and phone.

### Changed

- `GMAIL_MAILBOX_ALLOWLIST` is optional under `oauth`. It is still enforced when set, and still required under `delegated`.
- The dashboard is the landing page and settings sit inside the app shell. The separate onboarding flow is gone.

### Operator notes

- Existing delegated mailboxes keep working unchanged. Set `GMAIL_CONNECT_METHOD=delegated` to keep offering the delegated form for new connections.
- To use sign-in, add `<web origin>/gmail/callback` to the OAuth client's redirect URIs and list `gmail.readonly` (plus `gmail.send` if sending) on its consent screen. An Internal consent screen avoids Google's restricted-scope review.

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-09-24

### Breaking

- The Gmail connector refuses every mailbox not listed in `GMAIL_MAILBOX_ALLOWLIST` (comma separated, case insensitive). Installations already using Gmail must set it before upgrading, or their mailbox stops working.

### Added

- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_ROUTE` and `OPENAI_MODEL_ROUTE` route each vendor separately (`direct` or `google`), overriding `MODEL_ROUTE`.
- `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` sets the OpenAI organisation; unset, OpenAI bills the key's default organisation.

### Changed

- The Gmail send scope is optional: a read-only mailbox runs on arrival and can be searched, and a send says it lacks the scope.
- The in-app Gmail credential form checks the mailbox with Google before saving.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-09-22

### Breaking

- The per-user Gmail sign-in is removed, with `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` and `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`. Credentials from it no longer work; connect the mailbox again through the new connector.

### Added

- `gmail` adapter: one mailbox per connection, reached through Google domain wide delegation. Automations can run when mail arrives (polled about once a minute), search it with `where`, read attachments, and send or reply as it. A write along the mailbox's `Messages` edge sends new mail; one along a message's `Replies` edge replies.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- `READ(file)` returns a file's text. `CHUNKS(text, { size, overlap })` or `CHUNKS(text, { entities })` cuts a text into pieces.
- A plugin can be called on its own (`page = fetch_url(url: c.website)`); every bundled plugin declares what it returns, so the result is typed.
- A `write` into a local node builds or merges by identity, like a write into a system.
- `order by arrival`, `document` or `chronological` on a local node's entry, or after a nested declared node, keeps its order for `FIRST`, `JOIN` and `LIMIT`.
- Records are values: lists and maps can hold them, and `MAP` returns what its closure returns.
- A block can start from a list of records or from an expression that ends in one (`AT(rows, 0)-[c:company]-> { … }`).
- `research` plugin: web research on a record, resolving one that arrived with only a name.
- `dealroom` adapter: read-only companies, investors, people and funding rounds.
- Web search through Bright Data's SERP API (`WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=brightdata`), and a page reader of the product's own where the model host has none.
- `MODEL_ROUTE=google` sends every model call through one Google Cloud project and service account.
- An optional external judge for duplicate detection (`JEV_KEY` with `JEV_ENTITY_RESOLUTION=true`).
- Born-digital PDFs are read from their text layer without an OCR service.
- Handbook: reading and chunking files, local node writes, and enrichment as plain plugin calls followed by a second extraction.

### Changed

- A lone fuzzy duplicate candidate goes to the judge; a fuzzy value equal outright is an exact match; a bare domain name no longer matches every other domain.
- An extraction's output ceiling follows its effort; a turn that runs out steps down once, then fails with a clear error. A continued answer shows as a warning on the run.
- A narrowed polymorphic hop lands only the member it narrowed to.
- Affinity requests are cached per run.
- The checker flags a field declared twice in one extract stage, a closure in an expression slot, and a hop off a value.

### Fixed

- `${…}` in an extract field or node description is interpolated.
- Scheduled runs run as their team, so fetches inside them work.
- A file or page a run could not read says so on the run.
- One large source file can no longer crowd the rest out of an extraction prompt.
- The valuations MCP connector lists its tools again.

### Operator notes

- A deploy applies migration `001_add_dealroom_external_service_type.sql`.
- New optional settings: `MODEL_ROUTE`, `GOOGLE_MODEL_REGION`, `KNOWLEDGE_AGENT_PROVIDER`, `WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER`, `BRIGHT_DATA_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `BRIGHT_DATA_SERP_ZONE`, `BRIGHT_DATA_UNLOCKER_ZONE`, `EXTRACTION_FILE_CHARS`, `MAX_PDF_BUFFER_BYTES`, `JEV_KEY`, `JEV_ENTITY_RESOLUTION`.
- With `MODEL_ROUTE=google`, boot refuses a leftover vendor model key.

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- The bundled Postgres and Redis restart with the machine.
- `up.sh` supplies base URLs and ports as defaults that `.env` overrides; `LISTEN_FIRE_BIND` binds to one address, for installations behind a reverse proxy.
- A missing model key warns at boot instead of refusing to start.
- The published web image shows the Google and Microsoft sign-in buttons without a rebuild; client ids come from the api at runtime.
- A magic link has one expiry, and an expired link says so. A core installation prints its first sign-in link.

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Each migration applies in one transaction with its ledger row, so a failure leaves nothing half built. The runner creates the `agent` and `readonly` database roles itself when it may, and otherwise stops and names the file to run.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- First public release: five units (`core`, `knowledge`, `automations`, `valuations`, `asks`), the movement language and its handbook, and the adapters listed in the README.
- Tagged releases publish `api`, `web`, `admin` and `fake-channels` images to `ghcr.io/listen-fire` for amd64 and arm64.
- `LISTEN_FIRE_VERSION` pins an installation to a tag; `up.sh --build` builds from source instead.
- Each bundled datastore steps aside when an external one is configured.
- The running version shows at `/healthz/workers` and under Settings, About.
- Self-hosting guides for compose, Render, AWS and a GCP VM, and an upgrade runbook.
