# Changelog

Every pull request that changes what an operator sets or an author writes adds a line under Unreleased in the same pull request. Tagging a release moves the Unreleased entries under a heading for the new version, with the date.

Entries are written for two readers: an operator running a self-hosted installation (what to set, what a deploy applies, what behaves differently) and an author writing automations in the movement language (new or changed constructs, plugins, adapters, handbook idioms). The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions are the git tags described in [`deploy/UPGRADING.md`](deploy/UPGRADING.md).

## [Unreleased]

<!-- add merged PRs here -->

### Breaking

- The criteria form of `link` is retired. `x = link p-[:Edge]-> { … }` is now a parse error that names its replacement: find the record with `x = match p-[:Edge]-> { … }`, then connect it with `link p -[:Edge]-> x`. The handle form of `link` is unchanged.
- `vc_url_retrieval` called on its own returns a list of records, one per fetched link (`name`, `url`, `file`, `text`), instead of one string of all the page text. Hold one first, then read its fields: `deck = FIRST(linked)`, then `deck.text`.

### Added

- `match`: finds a record by identity without writing it. Same body and targets as `write` (`unique by` clauses plus asserted fields). A hit binds the record; a miss ends the enclosing scope quietly; used unbound it is a gate.
- `FUZZY` is declared per field. The checker refuses `FUZZY` on a field the target does not list, and names the fields it does.
- Valuations Legal Entity resolves `unique by` by identity, with fuzzy matching on Name, Legal Name, Also Known As and Other Names.
- Files a `through` plugin fetched land on the extracted record's `_resources`, so the usual attach pattern puts them on any record with a file field.
- A record held in a variable (`deck = FIRST(pages)`) reads by field.

### Changed

- The Bright Data SERP provider waits up to 90 s per request and retries a 429, a 5xx (including one reported only in `x-brd-status-code`), a timeout or an empty body, up to three attempts.
- A refusal from Google Custom Search is logged with its reason and fails the search, instead of reading as "no results".
- Website identity ignores scheme, `www.`, trailing slash and case.

### Fixed

- A write whose identity candidates were filtered could bind or update the wrong record.
- A valuations write with `unique by` created a new row every time instead of finding the existing one.
- `?:` on a valuations record now sees an existing value; a create no longer sends explicit nulls.

### Operator notes

- A deploy applies migration `20260928_123442_legal_entity_name_trigram.sql` (trigram indexes on legal entity names).
- Google has closed the Custom Search JSON API to new customers. New installations should set `WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=brightdata` with `BRIGHT_DATA_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `BRIGHT_DATA_SERP_ZONE`.

## [v0.6.2] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- Each run shows its model cost in the run history and the run detail, and on the MCP tools `listRuns`, `checkRun` and `inspectRun`.

## [v0.6.1] - 2026-09-25

### Changed

- `up.sh` refuses to start when the image store's disk has too little free space (`--no-space-check` skips this), and prunes older images after a healthy start, keeping one rollback tag in `LISTEN_FIRE_PREVIOUS_VERSION` (`--keep-images` skips this).
- The boot warning about a missing model key follows `MODEL_MAP`, so a deployment served entirely through a mapped provider is no longer warned.

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-09-25

### Breaking

- `MODEL_MAP` replaces `MODEL_ROUTE`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_ROUTE`, `OPENAI_MODEL_ROUTE` and `KNOWLEDGE_AGENT_PROVIDER`, which are no longer read. The map is a JSON object from a model name the product uses to `provider/wire-model`, with provider `anthropic`, `vertex`, `openai` or `gemini`. A deployment that set `MODEL_ROUTE=google` needs one of the Google maps in [`deploy/SELF_HOSTING.md`](deploy/SELF_HOSTING.md) before upgrading. Boot refuses a map it cannot serve.
- With no map set, the system, movement and ontology agents run on Claude (`claude-sonnet-5`) instead of GPT. Map `claude-sonnet-5` to `openai/gpt-5` to keep them on GPT.
- Image generation uses `gpt-image-1` on OpenAI (DALL-E 3 was shut down). Map `gpt-image-1` to a Gemini image model to keep Gemini images; a map naming `dall-e-3` is refused.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` alone no longer powers the agents; every chat call names a Claude model, so it needs a map sending those names to `openai`.
- A team's own model key is no longer used; every call uses the deployment's credentials.

### Added

- Gemini as a native chat provider, and transcription, embeddings and image generation routed through the same map.
- Research running on `openai` or `gemini` answers its searches through the deployment's own web search service.
- `GEMINI_BASE_URL` points Gemini calls at a stand-in service, for testing.
- Prices for Fable 5.1, Opus 4.6, undated Haiku 4.5 and `gpt-image-1`.

### Fixed

- Sonnet 5 is priced at $2/$10 per million tokens; dated Haiku 4.5 is priced as Haiku 4.5.
- Gemini image generation is addressed in `GOOGLE_MODEL_REGION`, not the OCR location.

### Operator notes

- A deploy applies migration `20260924_212525_llm_usage_preferred_model.sql`. Usage rows name the provider that served each call, the wire model, and the model name the product asked for.
- Moving an embedding model to another vendor means re-embedding stored vectors; boot refuses an embedding model narrower than its column.

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- A Gmail mailbox is connected by signing in as it. `GMAIL_CONNECT_METHOD` is `oauth` (the default) or `delegated`. The sign-in uses the Sheets and Drive OAuth client unless `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GMAIL_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are set.
- The Gmail connect form also accepts a pasted refresh token.
- `GMAIL_SEND_ENABLED=true` makes the sign-in ask for the send scope; without it, a signed-in mailbox is read-only.
- A team manages its own members from settings: grant and revoke access, add people directly, create service accounts, and edit the team's name, email and phone.

### Changed

- `GMAIL_MAILBOX_ALLOWLIST` is optional under `oauth`. It is still enforced when set, and still required under `delegated`.
- The dashboard is the landing page and settings sit inside the app shell. The separate onboarding flow is gone.

### Operator notes

- Existing delegated mailboxes keep working unchanged. Set `GMAIL_CONNECT_METHOD=delegated` to keep offering the delegated form for new connections.
- To use sign-in, add `<web origin>/gmail/callback` to the OAuth client's redirect URIs and list `gmail.readonly` (plus `gmail.send` if sending) on its consent screen. An Internal consent screen avoids Google's restricted-scope review.

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-09-24

### Breaking

- The Gmail connector refuses every mailbox not listed in `GMAIL_MAILBOX_ALLOWLIST` (comma separated, case insensitive). Installations already using Gmail must set it before upgrading, or their mailbox stops working.

### Added

- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_ROUTE` and `OPENAI_MODEL_ROUTE` route each vendor separately (`direct` or `google`), overriding `MODEL_ROUTE`.
- `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION` sets the OpenAI organisation; unset, OpenAI bills the key's default organisation.

### Changed

- The Gmail send scope is optional: a read-only mailbox runs on arrival and can be searched, and a send says it lacks the scope.
- The in-app Gmail credential form checks the mailbox with Google before saving.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-09-22

### Breaking

- The per-user Gmail sign-in is removed, with `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` and `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET`. Credentials from it no longer work; connect the mailbox again through the new connector.

### Added

- `gmail` adapter: one mailbox per connection, reached through Google domain wide delegation. Automations can run when mail arrives (polled about once a minute), search it with `where`, read attachments, and send or reply as it. A write along the mailbox's `Messages` edge sends new mail; one along a message's `Replies` edge replies.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- `READ(file)` returns a file's text. `CHUNKS(text, { size, overlap })` or `CHUNKS(text, { entities })` cuts a text into pieces.
- A plugin can be called on its own (`page = fetch_url(url: c.website)`); every bundled plugin declares what it returns, so the result is typed.
- A `write` into a local node builds or merges by identity, like a write into a system.
- `order by arrival`, `document` or `chronological` on a local node's entry, or after a nested declared node, keeps its order for `FIRST`, `JOIN` and `LIMIT`.
- Records are values: lists and maps can hold them, and `MAP` returns what its closure returns.
- A block can start from a list of records or from an expression that ends in one (`AT(rows, 0)-[c:company]-> { … }`).
- `research` plugin: web research on a record, resolving one that arrived with only a name.
- `dealroom` adapter: read-only companies, investors, people and funding rounds.
- Web search through Bright Data's SERP API (`WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER=brightdata`), and a page reader of the product's own where the model host has none.
- `MODEL_ROUTE=google` sends every model call through one Google Cloud project and service account.
- An optional external judge for duplicate detection (`JEV_KEY` with `JEV_ENTITY_RESOLUTION=true`).
- Born-digital PDFs are read from their text layer without an OCR service.
- Handbook: reading and chunking files, local node writes, and enrichment as plain plugin calls followed by a second extraction.

### Changed

- A lone fuzzy duplicate candidate goes to the judge; a fuzzy value equal outright is an exact match; a bare domain name no longer matches every other domain.
- An extraction's output ceiling follows its effort; a turn that runs out steps down once, then fails with a clear error. A continued answer shows as a warning on the run.
- A narrowed polymorphic hop lands only the member it narrowed to.
- Affinity requests are cached per run.
- The checker flags a field declared twice in one extract stage, a closure in an expression slot, and a hop off a value.

### Fixed

- `${…}` in an extract field or node description is interpolated.
- Scheduled runs run as their team, so fetches inside them work.
- A file or page a run could not read says so on the run.
- One large source file can no longer crowd the rest out of an extraction prompt.
- The valuations MCP connector lists its tools again.

### Operator notes

- A deploy applies migration `001_add_dealroom_external_service_type.sql`.
- New optional settings: `MODEL_ROUTE`, `GOOGLE_MODEL_REGION`, `KNOWLEDGE_AGENT_PROVIDER`, `WEB_SEARCH_PROVIDER`, `BRIGHT_DATA_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `BRIGHT_DATA_SERP_ZONE`, `BRIGHT_DATA_UNLOCKER_ZONE`, `EXTRACTION_FILE_CHARS`, `MAX_PDF_BUFFER_BYTES`, `JEV_KEY`, `JEV_ENTITY_RESOLUTION`.
- With `MODEL_ROUTE=google`, boot refuses a leftover vendor model key.

## [v0.1.2] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- The bundled Postgres and Redis restart with the machine.
- `up.sh` supplies base URLs and ports as defaults that `.env` overrides; `LISTEN_FIRE_BIND` binds to one address, for installations behind a reverse proxy.
- A missing model key warns at boot instead of refusing to start.
- The published web image shows the Google and Microsoft sign-in buttons without a rebuild; client ids come from the api at runtime.
- A magic link has one expiry, and an expired link says so. A core installation prints its first sign-in link.

## [v0.1.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Each migration applies in one transaction with its ledger row, so a failure leaves nothing half built. The runner creates the `agent` and `readonly` database roles itself when it may, and otherwise stops and names the file to run.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- First public release: five units (`core`, `knowledge`, `automations`, `valuations`, `asks`), the movement language and its handbook, and the adapters listed in the README.
- Tagged releases publish `api`, `web`, `admin` and `fake-channels` images to `ghcr.io/listen-fire` for amd64 and arm64.
- `LISTEN_FIRE_VERSION` pins an installation to a tag; `up.sh --build` builds from source instead.
- Each bundled datastore steps aside when an external one is configured.
- The running version shows at `/healthz/workers` and under Settings, About.
- Self-hosting guides for compose, Render, AWS and a GCP VM, and an upgrade runbook.
