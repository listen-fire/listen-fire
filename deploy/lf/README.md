# Deploying lf to a scale-from-zero platform

The image (`deploy/lf/Dockerfile`, built from the repository root) holds one binary, `lf`, plus the built-in Dealroom and web modules, and the cloud slot modules: `s3-files` (the files slot, a bucket on S3, GCS, R2 or MinIO), `postgres-limiter` (the limiter slot, one shared count across workers), `models` (the models slot on Gemini, OpenAI or Claude on Vertex, and the ocr slot on Gemini) and `document-ai` (the ocr slot on Google Document AI). Nothing is installed from npm.

The image is node-based and large (about 2.3 GB): the built-in modules are TypeScript and run under node (`serve-module` and tsx) from the pnpm workspace, whose install brings its dev tooling too. That is accepted, since size only costs pull time on a cold start.

Two commands make the whole deployment:

- **`lf serve --port $PORT`** is the doors: webhooks at `/hooks/<external>/<install>` and OAuth callbacks. It also drains due work while it is up. Run it as a container behind HTTPS. On compute billed by the request (frozen once a response is sent), add `--doors-only` (or set `LF_DOORS_ONLY=1`): it then drains nothing, and `/hooks/…` queues its events (202, the rows listed) instead of running them in the request.
- **`lf drain --until-idle --max-seconds N`** is a worker. It claims due work rows, runs them, and exits when none is due or after N seconds. Run it as a job.

The container keeps no state. Everything lives in Postgres, so any container can be stopped or replaced at any time, and any number of workers can drain at once (each row is claimed by one worker, each run stepped by whoever holds its lease).

## Configuration

- The store: the default project's `lf.yaml` names the Postgres store module (`core: { store: "@lf/postgres-store" }`). Its settings come from the environment: `LF_SECRET__POSTGRES_STORE__EXTERNAL=@lf/postgres-store` and `LF_SECRET__POSTGRES_STORE__URL`, the Postgres URL ending `?sslmode=verify-full` (TLS, certificate and host name checked). Set the URL as a platform secret.
- The store's schema: run `lf connect @lf/postgres-store` once (and again after an upgrade) with the same environment. It creates and migrates the store's own `lf` schema and exits.
- The files and limiter slots (both off by default): the image carries ready install entries `s3_files` and `postgres_limiter` under `/srv/lf/project/externals/`. Name them in `lf.yaml` (`core: { files: s3_files, limiter: postgres_limiter }`) and set their settings from the environment, as for the store: `LF_SECRET__S3_FILES__EXTERNAL=s3_files` with `__BUCKET`, `__REGION` and, as the service needs, `__ENDPOINT`, `__PATH_STYLE`, `__ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `__SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; `LF_SECRET__POSTGRES_LIMITER__EXTERNAL=postgres_limiter` with `__URL`. If you mount your own project over `/srv/lf/project`, copy those two folders from the image's `externals/`. They start by `command` under tsx, since a core module is not served with `module:`.
- Models on another vendor, and OCR (all off by default): the image carries the install entries `models`, `models_ocr` and `document_ai`. Name them in `lf.yaml` (`core: { models: models, ocr: document_ai }`, or `ocr: models_ocr` for Gemini reading the file itself) and set their settings from the environment: `LF_SECRET__MODELS__EXTERNAL=models` with `__VENDOR` and its credentials; `LF_SECRET__DOCUMENT_AI__EXTERNAL=document_ai` with `__PROJECT`, `__LOCATION`, `__PROCESSOR_ID` and, for long files, `__BUCKET`. On Google Cloud leave the service account settings unset to use the service's own identity. The commented `lf.yaml` in the image lists them.
- The secrets slot (off by default: the image reads credentials from `LF_SECRET__…` and an optional secrets file). Workers that share one vault of credentials, so a token one refreshes is kept for all and two workers refresh it once, fill the slot with a secrets module (the wire: [secrets-slot.md](../../docs/contracts/secrets-slot.md)). Give it an install entry under `/srv/lf/project/externals/`, name it in `lf.yaml` (`core: { secrets: acme_vault }`), and feed its own settings through the environment, not through itself: `LF_SECRET__ACME_VAULT__EXTERNAL=acme_vault` with `LF_SECRET__ACME_VAULT__<SETTING>` for each setting it declares. A project naming a secrets module whose settings are in neither the environment nor the secrets file is refused as it loads. The credentials then live in the module; `LF_SECRET__<CREDENTIAL>__<FIELD>` still lies over what it holds. A module that keeps them read-only (the deployment fills them) answers `lf credential` and `lf connect` with a refusal naming the module; a refreshed token is still written back.
- The movements slot (off by default: the image reads the movements folder of its project). A deployment that keeps each tenant's movements in a store of its own fills the slot with a movements module (the wire: [movements-slot.md](../../docs/contracts/movements-slot.md)). Give it an install entry under `/srv/lf/project/externals/` declaring a `tenant` setting, name it in `lf.yaml` (`core: { movements: acme_movements }`), and feed its settings through the environment, per process: `LF_SECRET__ACME_MOVEMENTS__EXTERNAL=acme_movements` with `LF_SECRET__ACME_MOVEMENTS__TENANT=<team id>`. lf sends them on every request and never reads the tenant itself. The module's settings never come from the secrets slot; a project naming a movements module whose settings are in neither the environment nor the secrets file is refused as it loads. `lf.yaml` and the externals folder stay in the image or the mounted project. A module that keeps the movements read-only makes `lf upgrade` and `lf init` refuse with a message naming it.
- `PORT`: the port `serve` listens on (default 8080). `LF_BIND` defaults to `0.0.0.0` in the image (the binary's own default is loopback).
- Credentials for third parties: `LF_SECRET__<CREDENTIAL>__<FIELD>` environment variables.
- `publicUrl` in `lf.yaml`: the HTTPS address the platform gives the serve container, needed for OAuth redirects.
- Your movements: mount or bake your own project folder over `/srv/lf/project` (its `lf.yaml`, `movements/`, `externals/`). The default project has no movements.

## The secrets module

See the secrets bullet under Configuration: the module is named in `lf.yaml`, and its settings come from `LF_SECRET__<MODULE>__<SETTING>`. Check a module of your own against the contract with `lf --contract-secrets-slot --dir <project>` and the cases in `secrets_slot_contract.test.ts`.

## The movements module

See the movements bullet under Configuration: the module is named in `lf.yaml`, and its settings, the tenant among them, come from `LF_SECRET__<MODULE>__<SETTING>`. Check a module of your own against the contract with `lf --contract-movements-slot --dir <project>` and the cases in `movements_slot_contract.test.ts`.

## The platform shape

1. Deploy the image as a service running its default command, with minimum instances at least 1 (or 0 if the platform wakes a container on the first request and senders retry webhooks), HTTPS in front, and the store's environment set.
2. Deploy the same image as a job whose command is `lf drain --until-idle --max-seconds 55`, with the same environment. Trigger it:
   - on a schedule (every minute) for timers and awaits to wake, or
   - by queue depth, where the platform can scale jobs on a Postgres query: start one worker per few due rows.
3. A worker that finds nothing due exits at once, so a frequent schedule costs little.
4. To start a worker as soon as work is due rather than on the next tick, fill the [wake slot](../../docs/core-slots.md#the-wake) with a queue module (Google Cloud Tasks ships separately). lf tells it "ready now" when the doors queue an event and "ready at T" when a run parks on a timer. Keep the schedule: it finds work whose wake failed.

Set `--max-seconds` below the platform's job time limit: it stops claiming new rows after N seconds, and a run in progress finishes its step first.

## Local trial

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/lf/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Starts Postgres, runs the store's setup, then one `serve` on port 8080 and a drain loop.
