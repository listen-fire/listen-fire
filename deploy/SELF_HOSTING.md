# Self-hosting Listen-Fire

## Quick start

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd <this repo>
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env      # set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY — or set nothing and add --demo
./deploy/up.sh knowledge automations    # any combination of the five units below
```

`up.sh` builds the images, waits for the stack to answer, and prints the web URL and the credential to sign in with. Add `--demo` to run with stand-in third-party services and a sample dataset, and no keys at all.

**Give Docker about 8 GiB, and never build the images together.** The api build and the web build each ask for a 6 GiB node heap, and a single `docker compose up --build` hands every service to one BuildKit session, which runs them concurrently — an out-of-memory kill on a stock Docker Desktop, reported as a broken repository rather than a full machine. `up.sh` builds one image at a time for exactly this reason, and the first build takes several minutes.

## What you are choosing

Listen-Fire comes apart into five units. They are the same image with a different environment, so a composition is configuration rather than a fork, and adding a unit later is a restart rather than a migration.

| unit | what it runs |
|---|---|
| `asks` | ask a person a question, get the answer back to your system |
| `valuations` | what you own and what it is worth, and an API that values it on a date |
| `knowledge` | a graph of the things you track and how they relate |
| `automations` | small programs over your other systems, and the surface that authors them |
| `core` | accounts, teams, invitations, login, and the connector that lets an agent sign in on a person's behalf |

**Naming `core` is the identity decision, and it is the only one.** Without it the installation is single-tenant: one team, one generated API key, and you sign in to the web UI by pasting that key. With it you get real accounts, invitations, and login by emailed link or password. There is no third shape, and no half of one — naming `core` without the matching identity setting (or the reverse) fails at boot rather than at the first request.

Everything else follows from the unit list. Which pages the web UI shows, which API routes answer, which background loops run, and which delivery path a graph change or a settled question takes are all derived from it; a page for a unit you did not choose is never shown, and a route for one answers 404.

## Two ways to start it

**`./deploy/up.sh <units…> [--demo]`** is the door for a trial on your own machine. It works out the identity setting, the delivery paths and the optional services from the units you name, waits for health, and prints how to sign in. It also pins the public URLs to `http://localhost:<port>`, which is what makes the printed links work — and what makes it the wrong tool for a deployment behind a real hostname.

**Building each image, then `docker compose up -d`, run from `deploy/`**, is the production shape. Build them one at a time, for the memory reason above — there is no supported `up --build`:

```bash
# migrate and seed share the api image; the admin one is only worth building
# with core, and it needs its profile named because it lives behind one
docker compose build api && docker compose build web \
  && docker compose --profile admin build admin \
  && docker compose up -d
```

`docker compose build <service>` has been seen to hang on at least one machine where the plain builder works. `docker build` against the same Dockerfile is the exact equivalent, run from the repository root, and is what `up.sh` itself calls:

```bash
docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile -t listen-fire-api:local .
docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile.web --target web -t listen-fire-web:local .
docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile.web --target admin -t listen-fire-admin:local .
```

With nothing else set it is the whole of Listen-Fire — every unit, with accounts and login. To run a subset, or to run behind your own hostname, put the settings in `deploy/.env` and start compose directly:

```bash
# deploy/.env
LISTEN_FIRE_PRODUCTS=knowledge,automations
LISTEN_FIRE_PRINCIPAL=static                 # `core` when the unit list includes core
KNOWLEDGE_MUTATION_DELIVERY=local      # `webhook` unless knowledge AND automations are both listed
ASKS_SETTLE_DELIVERY=webhook           # `local` only when asks AND automations are both listed
API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
WEB_BASE_URL=https://app.example.com
```

Two profiles add the optional pieces: `--profile admin` adds the operator console (only useful with `core`), and `--profile demo` adds the stand-in third-party services and the sample data. **`--profile demo` on its own is not a working demo** — the demo also needs the environment `up.sh` sets for it, and without that the API runs in production mode and the login email goes to a mail provider you have not configured instead of the fake outbox.

Redis always runs. It is not behind a profile because the default composition is every unit, and two of them keep state there.

## Ports

| service | host port | when |
|---|---|---|
| web UI | 8080 | always |
| API | 8081 | always |
| operator console | 8082 | only with `core` |
| stand-in third parties | 8083, bound to `127.0.0.1` | only in demo mode |

Postgres and Redis publish no host port at all, so a self-hosted stack never collides with anything else on the machine. The stand-in third parties are the one service bound to `127.0.0.1` rather than to every interface: their email outbox holds live single-use login links, and anything that can read one is signed in. Change the published ports with `WEB_PORT`, `API_PORT`, `ADMIN_PORT` and `FAKE_CHANNELS_PORT_HOST` — in `deploy/.env` for `docker compose`, or in the shell for `up.sh` (`WEB_PORT=9000 ./deploy/up.sh knowledge`), because `up.sh` exports its own values and a shell value wins over the file.

The browser only ever talks to the web UI's own origin: the web container proxies API calls to the API container over the internal network. That is why the image bakes in no API hostname, and why one image runs anywhere.

## What the installation generates for itself

On its very first boot, before anything else starts, Listen-Fire mints every secret this installation will ever use and writes them into a Docker volume called `listen-fire-config`: the database password, the session-signing secret, both encryption keys, the team id, the API key, and the signing secrets for outbound webhooks and document links. You never see them in a file on disk, and no container image carries them.

**Back that volume up, and never regenerate it.**

```bash
docker run --rm -v listen-fire_listen-fire-config:/config -v "$PWD:/out" \
  node:22.20.0-slim tar czf /out/listen-fire-config-backup.tgz -C /config .
```

Three of those values are one-way doors, which is why the generator refuses to overwrite a config volume that already exists:

- Rotating either encryption key makes every stored third-party credential **permanently unreadable**. Every connection has to be made again by hand, which for the systems you register yourself means every user re-authorising.
- Rotating the session secret signs everybody out.
- Rotating the API key signs every web session out on a single-tenant installation, by design: the key is the session.

To read one of the generated values — the API key, the admin email — ask a container to source them for you. Note that `docker compose exec` does **not** work here: the secrets are loaded by the container's entrypoint, and `exec` runs beside it rather than through it.

```bash
docker compose run --rm --no-deps --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/with-generated-env api \
  sh -c 'printf "%s\n" "$LISTEN_FIRE_API_KEY"'
```

**`LISTEN_FIRE_API_KEY` is the credential only on a single-tenant installation.** It is generated in every shape, but with `core` mounted nothing accepts it: core validates sessions and api-key rows in its own database, and the generated key is neither, so presenting it is a 401. On a `core` installation the credential is the admin account — `LISTEN_FIRE_BOOTSTRAP_USER_EMAIL` from the same volume, read the same way — who signs in by emailed link, and mints api keys from the UI once signed in. `up.sh` prints whichever of the two applies to the shape you started.

## What you configure

`deploy/.env` is the human half — copy it from `deploy/.env.example`. It is read relative to the compose file, so it applies whichever directory you run `docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml` from.

**A model key is required** unless you start with `--demo`: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or `KNOWLEDGE_LLM_API_KEY`, or `OPENAI_API_KEY`). A deployment with no model key has no agents, no arbitration of conflicting facts and no extraction, so the installer refuses to mint an installation rather than let you find out later. That refusal is the only hard requirement in the file.

**Set your real URLs before you register anything or send anything.** `API_BASE_URL` and `WEB_BASE_URL` are where this installation is reachable from the internet, and both are used to build links that end up in other people's inboxes and in other systems' webhook registrations. They also decide cookie security: the session cookie is marked `Secure` only when those URLs are `https`, because a `Secure` cookie on a plain-http LAN address is set, silently dropped by the browser, and the person is bounced back to the login they just completed. Behind TLS, set them to your https URLs; on a plain-http trial, leave them http.

**`OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL` is your WEB origin**, not the API's. The consent screen returns the person to `<OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL>/<system>/callback`, and those pages are served by the web app; the API does not serve them at all. The compose file defaults it to `WEB_BASE_URL`, so the single-host shape is already right — set it explicitly only when the web app answers on a different origin from the one you gave `WEB_BASE_URL`.

`EXPOSED_FILE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is the same pair pointing the other way: a third party fetches an exposed file's bytes from the **API**, so the compose file defaults it to `API_BASE_URL`. Off compose it is worth setting by hand, because the code's own fallback is `OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL` — the web origin — and then a localhost literal.

Integration credentials are all optional. An OAuth connector whose client id and secret are unset is not offered in the catalogue at all, so nobody can start a connection that would fail.

**Name the things a third party renders.** The product name is fixed, but the name a Slack workspace shows and the name Meta prints in a WhatsApp template belong to whoever registered that app — and that is you. `SLACK_APP_DISPLAY_NAME` and `WHATSAPP_APP_DISPLAY_NAME` are those two names, each defaulting to `Listen-Fire`. `SUPPORT_EMAIL` is the third: where someone with a problem is told to go. It has no default, and unset means this installation publishes no address at all rather than sending people to an inbox that will not read them.

## First boot

Three things happen in order, once, and each is visible in the log.

1. **Secrets are minted** into `listen-fire-config` (above). This step refuses to start the stack if no model key is configured and you did not ask for a demo.
2. **Migrations run to completion** as a separate one-shot service before the API starts, so a restart never races the schema. If they fail, the API does not start at all.
3. **On a `core` installation, the first account is provisioned** against the empty database: your team, your admin user, and an internal identity that unauthenticated routes run as. It is all-or-nothing — a half-provisioned database is no longer empty and would never be provisioned again — and it is skipped forever once the installation has people in it.

The symptom worth recognising: an installation whose internal identity row is missing answers *"Invalid or expired session"* on every public route, which is every route login goes through. That is an unprovisioned installation seen from outside, not a stale cookie, and the boot log says so.

Papercut, stated plainly: **the first account is not a platform administrator**, so it cannot reach the operator console. Everything in the product itself works; only that console is out of reach, and there is no supported way to grant the flag from outside today.

## Signing in

**Single-tenant (no `core`).** `up.sh` prints the generated API key. Paste it into the web UI's login page, and use the same key as a `Authorization: Bearer …` token for the REST and agent-facing surfaces. Two things follow from the key being the whole credential: choose a long random one if you ever replace the generated key by hand, because the login door has no rate limit; and if the web UI cannot reach the API, its login page cannot know it is a single-tenant installation and will not offer the key form until the API answers.

**With `core`.** People sign in by email — a single-use link, or a password. In a demo, `up.sh` reads the link out of the stand-in mail outbox and prints it. In production the link is genuinely emailed, so **login does not work at all until a mail provider is configured** — either `RESEND_API_KEY`, or `MAILGUN_API_KEY` with `MAILGUN_SENDING_DOMAIN`, and in both cases `OUTBOUND_EMAIL_FROM`. This is the one place where absent mail is not a degradation but a locked door.

## Demo mode

`--demo` adds stand-in Attio, Slack, Airtable and an email outbox, and seeds a sample dataset: a starting model for venture dealflow, a graph of sample organisations, one working automation and one valuation case. Each piece is skipped when its unit is not mounted, so the same demo is correct for every combination. It also runs the API in non-production mode, which is what puts login email in the fake outbox instead of a mail provider.

Demo mode is a way to look at Listen-Fire, not a security posture. Do not expose it, and do not grow a real installation out of one.

## True in every shape

- **One always-on process.** The background loops run inside the API. There is no worker deployment to add, and no scale-to-zero: a process that stops between requests stops the schedulers and the resume loops with it.
- **Run one instance.** Two are safe — each unit's loops take a lock, so every loop runs on exactly one instance — but you lose the unambiguous reading of a worker reporting that it did not start here, which on a single instance means "wedged, page me".
- **`GET /.well-known/health-check` answers `201`.** That is its contract. A platform health check that defaults to expecting exactly `200` will drain a perfectly healthy target.
- **Two database roles must exist before the first migration.** The migration set grants to them, and a database without them dies on an early migration having built almost nothing. The bundled Postgres creates them from `postgres-init/00-roles.sql` automatically on an empty data directory; **a managed database has no such hook, so run that file by hand, as a superuser, before you start anything.** The bundled image is `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` because the migration set is monolithic.
- **The migration set is monolithic.** It creates every unit's tables whatever you mount, so a `psql` prompt shows tables you have no unit for. They stay empty. The practical consequence is that every installation needs the union of the extensions — `vector`, `pg_trgm`, `citext` — even one whose own tables need none of them.
- **`API_BASE_URL` must be stable forever.** Answer links, file links, callbacks and every webhook you register with a third party are absolute at it, and by the time you want to change the hostname they are in other people's inboxes and other systems' configuration. There is no rewrite mechanism and there cannot be one.
- **There is no local-filesystem file storage.** Anything that handles a file wants an S3-compatible bucket (AWS, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Supabase). The gap is deliberate: handing an unauthenticated third party a URL to fetch bytes from is a signed byte-serving route, which is a thing to build rather than a switch to flip. Without it the process boots normally and only the file-touching steps fail, naming what they wanted. When you do configure it, `AWS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` is compared to the literal lowercase `true` — `TRUE` and `1` read as false, which is what bites MinIO and Ceph.
- **A proxy in front of the API loses two things**: WebSocket upgrades, which live updates ride, and very long agent requests, which outlive most proxy timeouts. Both should reach the API origin directly.

## Asks

Your system creates a question over HTTP, a person answers it at a link that needs no account, and the answer comes back to you.

`ASKS_SETTLE_DELIVERY` decides how it comes back, and there is exactly one path — delivering both ways would announce one answer twice.

| value | what happens |
|---|---|
| `local` | The answer is handed to the automation engine in the same process. Correct only when `automations` is mounted here to be that engine. |
| `webhook` | Every settled question POSTs to the callback URL you gave when you created it: signed, retried six times over about fifteen hours, then given up on. |

`up.sh` sets `local` when `asks` and `automations` are both in the unit list and `webhook` otherwise, so you never have to choose. The signing secret is generated on first boot, so a standalone installation can deliver from the moment it starts.

Verify a delivery by recomputing `x-asks-signature: sha256=<HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body>`. Without a signing secret, deliveries are **held** — not attempted, not dropped — and the health surface says so. `GET /api/v1/asks/health` reports the delivery mode and the pending and failed counts.

**Answer links cannot be moved.** They are absolute at `API_BASE_URL` and they are already in somebody's inbox.

**A standalone asks installation is API-only.** Asks has no pages of its own — the answer link is served by the API, and the surface for watching and answering questions in the UI belongs to `automations`. So naming `asks` on its own gives you an HTTP surface and nothing to open in a browser; add `automations` if you want the UI.

## Valuations

Legal entities, investments, transactions, assets, prices and events, plus a compute endpoint that turns those rows into a holding's value on a date, in a currency you choose.

Every resource under `/api/v1/valuations/` has the same shape — list, read, create, update, delete — across `legal-entities`, `investments`, `transactions`, `assets`, `asset-transfers`, `prices` and `events`. Higher-level moves (a funding round, a share split, dividends, a wind-down) are single posts under `/api/v1/valuations/commands/`, and `POST /api/v1/valuations/compute` values a set of investments as of a date.

Changes go out through subscriptions **you register over the API**, not through a deployment-wide setting. The secret is yours, per destination: you generate it, Listen-Fire stores it and signs with it, and the signature is a bare hex digest with no prefix. Registration is idempotent by URL, event types are rejected at registration rather than becoming a subscription that never fires, and a failing destination is retried five times on an escalating backoff. The destination URL is read through the subscription at delivery time, so deleting a subscription stops its backlog in the same breath.

**Multi-currency valuation has no supported way to load exchange rates yet.** Rates are reference data: `/api/v1/valuations/exchange-rates` lists and filters them and nothing writes them, and the bundled command that fills the table resolves an acting user against the accounts tables, which a single-tenant installation does not have. If every holding and every valuation you ask for use one currency, none of this applies to you. If they do not, plan on loading the rate table over SQL until this is fixed.

## Knowledge

A store for the things you track and how they relate — entities, their properties, and the edges between them, over a model you define. The same store answers on two paths, and the split is deliberate rather than historical.

| path | speaks | for |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/v1/knowledge/…` | **names** — `Company`, `headquartered in` | people and agents: the model, natural-language queries, raw queries, CSV import and export |
| `/api/v1/knowledge/graph/…` | **ids only** | programs: nodes, upserts, matching, edges, deduplication rules, subscriptions |

A name is renameable, so a program that routed by one would silently stop matching the day somebody renamed a type. Integrations should use the id path and store ids. There is also an agent connector at `/api/v1/mcp/knowledge`, on the same credential.

**A store with no model key is a supported deployment, not a broken one.** Creating types, writing nodes and edges, querying, matching and CSV round-trips never call a model. One thing waits for a key: a property type can declare that conflicts between sources are settled by reading all the evidence rather than by taking the newest write. With no key, that worker keeps ticking, leaves every contested property **holding** the value that landed rather than guessing, and reports `"no model key configured"` as its reason. Losing arbitration is visible; it is never silent.

### Where graph changes go

Every write to the graph enqueues an event, and `KNOWLEDGE_MUTATION_DELIVERY` decides how it leaves. A deployment has exactly one path — delivering both ways would fire a downstream listener twice off one write.

| value | what happens |
|---|---|
| `local` | Handed to a consumer in the same process. That consumer exists only when `automations` is mounted here. |
| `webhook` | Delivered to the subscriptions you register over the API. With none registered, events drain quietly to nobody, which is the right shape for a store nothing is listening to yet. |

The CODE default is `local` — right for the composed deployment, wrong for a knowledge-only one, where every graph write's event would fail delivery and retry on a backoff. `up.sh` sets `webhook` unless `automations` and `knowledge` are BOTH mounted in the same process, so you never have to think about it; `KNOWLEDGE_MUTATION_DELIVERY` in `deploy/.env` overrides it if you must.

Subscriptions are registered at `/api/v1/knowledge/graph/webhooks`; an empty event-type list means every type, registration is idempotent by URL, and a secret is generated and returned if you supply none. Verify with a bare hex HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body. Registering a subscription while delivery is `local` is refused at the door with an explanation rather than accepted into silence. `GET /api/v1/knowledge/graph/health` reports the delivery mode, the outbox depth and last error, and whether a model key is configured.

Entity matching is exact (case-folded) plus trigram similarity — a model key is not what makes it work, and there is no vector search over the graph.

## Automations

An automation is a small program over your real systems: something happens — a schedule fires, a message arrives, a record changes — and it reads, decides, writes, and where it needs a person, stops and asks one.

**The long pole is not this file.** What your automations can reach depends on which third-party apps you register, and two of those have review queues you do not control. Start that work at the beginning of a project, not the end.

| tier | what it costs you | which systems |
|---|---|---|
| **Nothing to configure** | already working | schedules and cron, manual runs, questions to a person, the knowledge graph, plain HTTP requests, inbound webhooks. Email and WhatsApp also work as things an automation *listens to*. |
| **Your users paste a credential** | nothing to register | Affinity, Granola, Attio, and a remote adapter server you host yourself |
| **You register your own app** | see below | Slack, Attio, Airtable, Google Sheets and Drive, Gmail, Dropbox, Telegram, WhatsApp, Mailgun or Resend |

Airtable is in the third tier only: it is OAuth-only in this build, with no key-entry form. Attio is in both, and the app you register decides which: with `ATTIO_CLIENT_ID` / `ATTIO_CLIENT_SECRET` set your users sign in through Attio, and without them they paste a workspace access token instead.

Redis holds the runaway-loop guard's counters. The guard fails **open** if Redis is unreachable — automations keep running unguarded rather than stopping — but a production process with the two Redis settings unset throws the first time it reaches for the pool. Compose always runs Redis, so this matters only off compose.

Six background loops keep automations ticking: the schedule runner, the poll-driven listeners, the Airtable subscription refresh (Airtable expires subscriptions on a timer, and without the refresh those listens go quiet with no error), the expired-file sweep, and the two loops that resume an automation parked on an answer or on a timer. Automations has no health route of its own; they all report through `/healthz/workers`.

### Connecting Claude

Claude adds Listen-Fire as a custom connector, not from a directory listing — this installation isn't in one. In Claude, open Settings → Connectors, choose "Add custom connector", and paste `<API_BASE_URL>/api/v1/mcp/automation`. Claude then sends the person back to this installation to sign in, and that sign-in is OAuth through `core` — so `core` must be in the unit list, and its login working, before anyone can connect.

The onboarding screen shows these steps and the exact URL to paste; nobody needs to read them here. `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLAUDE_DIRECTORY_URL` is for the opposite case — a deployment actually listed in Claude's connector directory — and is not something a self-host sets; leave it unset so the paste-the-URL steps show instead of a directory link that goes nowhere.

### What a single-tenant installation cannot do

Four things bind to a **person** rather than to a credential, and refuse a machine credential with a message naming the fix rather than inventing a user: connecting a credential to a third-party system, granting access to a specific file or folder, linking a WhatsApp number, and confirming its code. Starting a new conversation with the authoring agent refuses for the same reason; continuing an existing one works.

The consequence, bluntly: **a single-tenant installation can register the third-party apps but cannot attach anybody's account to them.** Connecting accounts needs `core` in the unit list.

## Core

Accounts, teams, invitations, login, and the OAuth server that lets an agent connect to this installation on a person's behalf. You run it as soon as more than one human needs an account of their own; that is the whole decision.

**On its own, core serves nothing to use.** A core-only installation can invite people and sign them in, and nothing else. It is a sensible base and a strange destination.

**Sign-in is invited-only.** There is no self-serve signup: an address that is neither an existing account nor a pending invitation is refused with "Ask an admin of your team to add you." An admin adds an address on `/settings/team` and that is the whole act — nothing is emailed, and the person joins the first time they sign in with it. Removing a member ends their memberships and kills their live sessions; re-adding the address lets them back in.

Login is by emailed link or by password, and both need working mail — see "Signing in". Google and Microsoft sign-in buttons appear only if you configure their client ids: `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` on the API and the same id as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` on the web app (a build-time value); `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` on the API and `NEXT_PUBLIC_MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` on the web app. The Google client is a web-application OAuth client whose authorised JavaScript origin is `WEB_BASE_URL`; sign-in uses the token flow, so it needs no redirect URI.

Redis is what makes the agent connect flow survive a restart: somebody clicks connect, consents, and their agent then exchanges a code for a token, which has to outlive whatever happens to the process in between. Held only in memory, an in-flight connection dies at a deploy and the exchange fails *after* the person has already consented, which is felt as a connect button that needed pressing twice.

If you terminate TLS at a proxy that does not forward the original host, set `PUBLIC_URL` to the API's own origin: it is what the agent connector advertises as its issuer, and a wrong one sends connectors to the wrong place.

The operator console (port 8082) is a platform-administration surface and only makes sense with `core`. The first provisioned account cannot reach it — see "First boot".

## Registering your own third-party apps

Every one of these is a **new** app of yours. None of your users' existing connections carry over: a stored credential authenticates to the app that issued it, so each person re-authorises individually against yours.

Throughout, `API_BASE_URL` is the API's public origin and `OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL` is the **web** app's origin.

### Slack

A Slack app in your own workspace or organisation. Same-day for an app installed only where you control the workspace; Slack's public directory review is weeks, and you need it only to distribute beyond your own organisation.

Set `SLACK_MOVEMENTS_CLIENT_ID`, `SLACK_MOVEMENTS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SLACK_MOVEMENTS_SIGNING_SECRET`, `SLACK_MOVEMENTS_STATE_SECRET` and `SLACK_MOVEMENTS_REDIRECT_URI` — all five together, or the connector does not wire up.

The app is yours, so its name is too: `SLACK_APP_DISPLAY_NAME` is what this installation calls it when it speaks about it, and it defaults to `Listen-Fire`. Set it to whatever you named the app in Slack.

| Slack setting | value |
|---|---|
| Event Subscriptions → Request URL | `<API_BASE_URL>/api/public/slack/events` |
| Interactivity & Shortcuts → Request URL | `<API_BASE_URL>/api/public/slack-actions` |
| OAuth & Permissions → Redirect URL | exactly what you put in `SLACK_MOVEMENTS_REDIRECT_URI` |

Slack is the one system whose redirect you control outright: the value is passed through verbatim rather than derived, so set it to `<WEB_BASE_URL>/slack/callback` and paste exactly that.

An automation that listens to a workspace through its own subscription gets a second inbound door at `<API_BASE_URL>/api/public/webhook-sync/slack/<subscription id>`, pasted by hand because Slack has no API for registering one.

**Sharp edge.** The signing secret is what proves an event came from Slack. Unset, the door is fail-closed **everywhere** — every inbound event rejected, in production and out of it, because a staging box on the public internet is as reachable as a production one. The single exception is deliberate: `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WEBHOOKS=true` accepts unsigned deliveries, is ignored outright in production, and warns loudly the first time it applies.

### Attio and Airtable

An OAuth integration in each vendor's developer settings. Hours, no review. Set `ATTIO_CLIENT_ID` / `ATTIO_CLIENT_SECRET` and `AIRTABLE_CLIENT_ID` / `AIRTABLE_CLIENT_SECRET`; the redirect URLs are `<OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL>/attio/callback` and `<OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL>/airtable/callback`.

Attio's pair is optional. Leave it unset and the connect form asks for a workspace access token, which a workspace admin creates under Workspace settings then Developers; the form lists the scopes to grant it. Everything downstream is identical — an access token authenticates exactly like an OAuth one.

Record-change subscriptions register themselves. When an automation that listens to one of these is saved, Listen-Fire subscribes with the team's own credential at `<API_BASE_URL>/api/public/webhook-sync/<system>/<subscription id>` — nothing to paste, and re-saving after a hostname change re-registers everything.

### Google Sheets and Drive, and Gmail

A Google Cloud project, a consent screen, and a web-application OAuth client. `GOOGLE_INTEGRATIONS_CLIENT_ID` / `_CLIENT_SECRET` for Sheets and Drive; `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` / `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` for Gmail, which reads its own pair and is therefore a separate client even inside one project. Redirects are `<OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL>/google-integrations/callback` and `<OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL>/gmail/callback`.

Days to weeks, and the longest of it is Gmail. Drive scopes are sensitive or restricted depending on what your automations do, and Gmail's are restricted outright — which means Google's verification review and, depending on scope and user count, an independent security assessment. Until you are verified the consent screen warns people and the app is capped at a handful of test accounts you enumerate by hand.

Neither pushes anything: Sheets and Drive are read on a schedule or on demand, and inbound mail arrives through whichever mail provider is configured. Beyond re-authorising, each person also re-grants the specific files and folders an automation may touch, which is one of the four person-bound surfaces above.

### Dropbox

An app in the Dropbox console, `DROPBOX_CLIENT_ID` / `DROPBOX_CLIENT_SECRET`, redirect `<OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL>/dropbox/callback`. Hours to create; a development app is capped at a few linked accounts until you apply for production status, which is a review measured in days.

### Telegram

Your own bot, from BotFather, in minutes. `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME`, `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

You register the webhook yourself through Telegram's `setWebhook`, pointing at `<API_BASE_URL>/api/public/telegram/builtin` with the secret token set to the same value; an automation using its own bot gets the per-subscription door at `<API_BASE_URL>/api/public/webhook-sync/telegram/<subscription id>` instead. That header is the only thing proving a delivery came from Telegram, and the door is fail-closed everywhere without it.

The bot's @username is new and public. Anyone who keeps messaging the old one is talking to somebody else's bot.

### WhatsApp

A Meta app, a WhatsApp Business Account and a phone number on it. **Weeks** — business verification is a document review on Meta's side, and the number cannot carry traffic until it clears. This is the longest lead time in the document; start it first.

`WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID`, `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `WHATSAPP_MOVEMENTS_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`, `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Set `WHATSAPP_MOVEMENTS_NUMBER` too — the number in full international format (`+447700900000`), which is what the authoring agent quotes and what the settings page offers to verify against; leave it unset and neither names a number. Also `PHONE_VERIFICATION_SECRET`, which peppers the stored hash of the six-digit verification code — without one only you know, a leaked row yields the code by exhaustive search, and in production verification fails naming it.

In the Meta app's webhook configuration, set the callback URL to `<API_BASE_URL>/api/public/whatsapp/webhook` and the verify token to the same string as `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`; Meta calls it with a GET to confirm before delivering anything.

The authentication template is registered with Meta per deployment, and Meta substitutes an app name into the code it sends. `WHATSAPP_APP_DISPLAY_NAME` is that name, defaulting to `Listen-Fire`; set it to match the template you registered, so the message a recipient reads names your app rather than someone else's.

One outbound path runs through a separate messaging provider (`TWILIO_NUMBER`, `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`). With any of them unset, production sends nothing and says so in the log rather than pretending to deliver.

A new number means every conversation starts fresh; counterparty threads do not carry over.

### Email, through Mailgun or Resend

Pick one. Both carry mail in both directions, and configuring both is not a way to have two — Resend wins, for inbound and outbound alike, because a deployment must have exactly one answer to where its mail comes in. The boot log says which one it settled on.

Either way you also set `INBOUND_EMAIL_ADDRESS` — the address automations receive on, local part and domain, e.g. `inbox@yourdomain.com`. There is no default: a default would have your automations tell their authors to forward mail to somebody else's inbox. An automation that listens for email while it is unset is reported as unverified rather than quietly never firing.

**Mailgun.** A domain and an inbound route on it. Hours, gated on DNS propagation. `MAILGUN_API_KEY`, `MAILGUN_SENDING_DOMAIN`, `OUTBOUND_EMAIL_FROM`, and optionally `OUTBOUND_EMAIL_FROM_NAME`, `OUTBOUND_EMAIL_BCC` and `MAILGUN_API_BASE_URL` (the region endpoint defaults to Mailgun's EU host; a US-region account must set `https://api.mailgun.net`). Create a route that forwards to `<API_BASE_URL>/api/mailgun/callback`. The signature on that delivery is checked against the API key, so inbound mail needs the key even if you never send a message.

**Resend.** A verified domain with an MX record pointing at Resend, and a webhook. `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `OUTBOUND_EMAIL_FROM`, and optionally `OUTBOUND_EMAIL_FROM_NAME` and `OUTBOUND_EMAIL_BCC`. Subscribe a webhook to `email.received` and point it at `<API_BASE_URL>/api/resend/callback`; the `whsec_…` secret Resend shows you is `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Resend's webhook carries only ids, so the API fetches the body and the attachments with the key — inbound needs it as much as sending does.

Sending needs the from-address plus a provider's credentials in full; missing any of them, production gets a loudly-failing sender rather than mail that quietly evaporates.

Nothing to re-authorise — but any address automations used to receive on is now a different address, so whoever mails into it has to be told.

### Cutover cannot be fully parallel-run

Automations driven by a schedule or a poll can genuinely run on both the old and the new stack at once and be compared run for run. Event-driven ones cannot: a Slack event, a Telegram update or a WhatsApp message is delivered to exactly one registered app, so "parallel" for those means one side is dark. Parallel-run the schedule- and poll-driven automations for a week, then cut the event-driven ones over one system at a time.

## Health

| endpoint | auth | what it tells you |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /.well-known/health-check` | none | the process is up, answering `201`. This is what a platform probe should call. |
| `GET /healthz/workers` | none | every background loop this installation runs, whether this process started it, its last tick, and a reason for any deliberately idle one. |
| `GET /api/v1/valuations/health` | API key | outbound delivery health, with error text |
| `GET /api/v1/knowledge/graph/health` | API key | graph delivery mode, outbox depth, and whether a model key is configured |
| `GET /api/v1/asks/health` | API key | delivery mode plus pending and failed counts |

`/healthz/workers` is unauthenticated by design — the operator of a self-hosted installation is whoever can reach the process — and carries no free text, deliberately, because a delivery error would name a customer's webhook URL.

Two readings to get right before you alert on it. A unit you do not run contributes **no rows**: absence is the answer, not an error. And a mounted loop reporting that it did not start here means either "another instance holds the lock" or "wedged and never started here" — unambiguous only because you kept it to one instance.

## Upgrading

```bash
git pull
# from deploy/, serially, as above; drop the admin line without core
docker compose build api && docker compose build web \
  && docker compose --profile admin build admin \
  && docker compose up -d
```

Migrations run as a one-shot service before the new API starts. They are forward-only and applied by file name; **back up your database before an upgrade, because there is no down-migration path.** The config volume is untouched by an upgrade — it is generated once and never rewritten.

## Stopping and removing

```bash
# from deploy/ — stop everything, keep the data
docker compose --profile admin --profile demo down

# stop everything AND destroy it: database, redis, and the config volume
docker compose --profile admin --profile demo down -v
```

**Name both profiles.** `admin` and `demo` are the only two, and a `down` that omits them leaves their containers running for the next start to inherit — which is how a stack ends up with the previous shape's operator console or stand-in third parties still attached.

`down` keeps every volume, so starting again resumes the same installation. **`down -v` also destroys `listen-fire-config`**, which is the volume the section above says must never be regenerated: the encryption keys go with it, and every stored third-party credential in a database you restore afterwards is then permanently unreadable. Use `down -v` to throw an installation away, never to restart one — and if you only meant to reclaim the disk, back the config volume up first.

## Moving a team in or out

Three commands move one team's data between installations without touching anyone else's: an export writes a portable bundle, an import loads one into a target, and a delete removes a team and everything belonging to it. Together they are how an offboarding, a move to your own infrastructure, or a copy into staging actually gets done.

Run them through the same wrapper that loads the generated secrets, with a directory mounted for the bundle:

```bash
docker compose run --rm -v "$PWD/bundles:/bundles" \
  --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/with-generated-env api \
  sh -c 'pnpm cli export-team --team <uuid> --out /bundles/acme'
```

`--products` narrows what is carried (it defaults to all five), `--without-history` omits run, message and delivery history — the bulkiest and most sensitive part of a bundle — and `--database-url` overrides the database, so you can point one at a database whose application half cannot even boot, which is the state an offboarding tends to find things in. `import-team --in <dir>` and `delete-team --team <uuid> --confirm` take the same shape.

**A bundle is a plain directory**: a manifest plus one file per table, every value in Postgres's own text representation, so numerics, timestamps, JSON, arrays and enums cross unchanged and the files stay readable before you hand them to anybody. The manifest records each table's columns, its row count and a digest that the import checks before trusting a single row. Two exports of unchanged data are byte-identical but for the line naming when they ran.

**Import refuses rather than guesses.** A target at a different migration point, a carried table missing a column there, or the team already having rows there each stop it before anything is written — a row whose id matches but whose contents differ is either an edit on the target or a stale export, and only a person knows which. Deleting the team and importing again is the supported way to redo one. Ids are never re-minted, which is what lets automations, subscriptions and graph edges keep resolving on the other side, and the load runs with database triggers suppressed, so the audit trail does not attribute the tenant's whole history to whoever ran the import and the outboxes do not re-deliver carried rows as though they had just happened.

**Credentials arrive as shells.** Read this before importing anything with automations in it. A connection's id, name and type cross intact, so every trigger and subscription that references it still resolves — but the secret does not. It is bound by encryption to the source installation's key, and for any app you registered yourself it authenticates against the source operator's registration, so it would be worthless against yours however it were carried. Each shell is stamped as needing reconnection, and an automation that reaches for one fails by name rather than with an opaque decryption error. Afterwards you have two jobs: reconnect every connection against your own app registrations, and re-save every listening trigger so it registers a fresh subscription at the new hostname.

**Not carried, and why.** The audit trail (it records writes against the source database); the undelivered outboxes (events addressed to the source's subscribers — carrying them would fire the target's listeners for writes it never saw); live single-use capabilities and codes minted for the source origin; a pasted model key and the handle on the source operator's own app registration. One genuine gap rather than a policy choice: the table behind temporarily exposed files carries no team and no owner, so there is no expression that selects one tenant's rows out of it — it can be neither exported nor purged per team. Those rows expire on their own and their URLs are absolute at the source origin, so they are dead at cutover anyway.

**Two asymmetries worth knowing.** Currency reference data travels with the bundle even though it belongs to the installation rather than the team, because a fresh target has none and the team's own prices point at it; if the target already has its own copy, that copy wins, and a team deletion never removes it. And a person who also belongs to another team is spared by a delete, along with their contact rows — a person is not one team's property — which is one reason the executed row count is usually lower than the dry run's.

A delete without `--confirm` only reports what would go. `--confirm` is the whole opt-in. It reaches the usage tables too, so an offboarding does not leave history behind, and it derives its order from the database's own foreign keys rather than a hand-maintained list — the deletion succeeding is itself the proof the order was right.

WhatsApp is the exception to `--products`: its tenancy is only expressible through the accounts tables, so exporting without `core` declines those tables by name rather than emitting them empty.

## Verifying an installation

`deploy/smoke.sh` boots four different unit combinations from clean Docker state, asserts health, the capability answer, login by both doors and that the product pages render, and tears each one down with its volumes before the next — so the first-boot path is what is actually under test. It builds four images and four stacks, so budget about ten minutes rather than seconds.

## Environment reference

Everything here is set by you, in `deploy/.env`. Nothing in this table is generated, and nothing generated belongs in this file.

| variable | required | unset behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | yes, unless `--demo` | the installer refuses to mint an installation. Also the key the agents use, and the fallback for the graph's arbitration |
| `KNOWLEDGE_LLM_API_KEY` | no | falls back to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; with neither, contested properties hold their value and the queue grows, visibly |
| `KNOWLEDGE_LLM_MODEL` | no | `claude-opus-5` |
| `KNOWLEDGE_AGENT_PROVIDER` | recommended | which provider the conversational surfaces use; the default is not the same in all of them, so set it rather than inherit the disagreement |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | only for `KNOWLEDGE_AGENT_PROVIDER=openai` | nothing else reads it — it is not what makes entity matching work |
| `LISTEN_FIRE_TEAM_NAME` | no | `Acme`. Read only on first boot, into the generated config |
| `LISTEN_FIRE_ADMIN_EMAIL` | recommended with `core` | `admin@listen-fire.local` — the address the first account is provisioned with, and the one that receives login links |
| `SLACK_APP_DISPLAY_NAME` | no | `Listen-Fire` — the name your Slack app shows in a workspace, which is yours to pick because the app is yours |
| `WHATSAPP_APP_DISPLAY_NAME` | no | `Listen-Fire` — the app name Meta substitutes into the WhatsApp authentication template you registered |
| `SUPPORT_EMAIL` | no | no address is published: anything that would point someone at support says nothing rather than inventing an inbox |
| `API_BASE_URL` | yes in production | `http://localhost:8081`. Must be stable forever; also decides cookie security with the one below |
| `WEB_BASE_URL` | yes in production | `http://localhost:8080`. Where login links point |
| `OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL` | only if the web app is on a different origin from `WEB_BASE_URL` | compose defaults it to `WEB_BASE_URL`, which is where those callback pages are served |
| `EXPOSED_FILE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | only off compose | compose defaults it to `API_BASE_URL`. The code's own fallback is `OAUTH_REDIRECT_BASE_URL` and then a localhost literal — the one URL default that degrades quietly |
| `LISTEN_FIRE_DEMO` | no | `0`. `--demo` sets `1`, which is what wires the stand-in third parties to the installation and lets the sample dataset be seeded. Not something to turn on by hand on a real installation |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | only behind a host-rewriting proxy | the agent connector's issuer origin is derived from the request |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLAUDE_DIRECTORY_URL` | no, and not for a self-host | unset. A build-time value on the web app, set only for the one deployment listed in Claude's connector directory; unset shows the paste-the-URL custom-connector steps instead |
| `WEB_PORT` / `API_PORT` / `ADMIN_PORT` / `FAKE_CHANNELS_PORT_HOST` | no | 8080 / 8081 / 8082 / 8083 |
| `KNOWLEDGE_MUTATION_DELIVERY` | no | derived from your unit list by `up.sh`; the code's own default is `local`. An unrecognised value fails the boot rather than picking one |
| `ASKS_SETTLE_DELIVERY` | no | as above |
| `LISTEN_FIRE_PRODUCTS` | only without `up.sh` | every unit. An unknown name fails the boot |
| `LISTEN_FIRE_PRINCIPAL` | only without `up.sh` | `core`. Must agree with whether `core` is in the unit list, checked in both directions |
| `LISTEN_FIRE_SCOPES` | no | `*` — the API key grants everything. Narrow it to what a key actually needs |
| `LISTEN_FIRE_ACCESS` | no | `write`; `read` makes the key read-only |
| `LISTEN_FIRE_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS` | no | `false`. `true` removes the key requirement entirely — only on an API nothing else can reach |
| `OUTBOUND_EMAIL_FROM` plus one provider's credentials | yes with `core` in production | no mail is sent, so nobody can log in |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` / `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | with Resend | Mailgun is used instead, if it is configured |
| `MAILGUN_API_KEY` / `MAILGUN_SENDING_DOMAIN` | with Mailgun | as above, in reverse |
| `MAILGUN_API_BASE_URL` | US-region Mailgun accounts | Mailgun's EU host |
| `INBOUND_EMAIL_ADDRESS` | to receive mail at all | none — an automation listening for email is reported unverified |
| `OUTBOUND_EMAIL_FROM_NAME` / `OUTBOUND_EMAIL_BCC` | no | no display name; no archive copy |
| `AWS_DOCUMENT_S3_BUCKET` / `AWS_REGION` / `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | only for files | all four together, or no storage at all; file-touching steps fail naming them |
| `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT` | non-AWS S3 | AWS is assumed |
| `AWS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` | MinIO and Ceph | off — and only the literal lowercase `true` turns it on |
| `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WEBHOOKS` | no | inbound doors stay fail-closed. `true` only on a machine nothing else can reach; ignored in production |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | no | no error reporting |

The per-system credentials for Slack, Attio, Airtable, Google, Gmail, Dropbox, Telegram, WhatsApp and Twilio are listed with what they do in "Registering your own third-party apps". Every one is optional, and an unset OAuth pair means that system is simply not offered — except Attio's, where it means Attio connects with a pasted access token instead.

Generated on first boot and read from the config volume, never from this file: the database URLs, the session-signing secret and its audience, both encryption keys, the outbound-webhook and document-link signing secrets, the team id and name, the user id, the API key, and the first account's email.

## Running it somewhere other than compose

`guides/` translates this runbook onto specific platforms — [Render](guides/render.md), [Vercel plus a container](guides/vercel-plus-container.md), [AWS](guides/aws.md) — covering what changes when there is no one-shot migration service and no init hook to create the database roles for you. [`guides/byo-auth.md`](guides/byo-auth.md) is the other kind of substitution: pointing Listen-Fire at your own identity system instead of the two that ship.

Off compose, the secrets this installation generates for itself are yours to supply and to keep: mint them once, store them where you store secrets, and never rotate the encryption pair.
