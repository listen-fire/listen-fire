//! The run host's rules over the backend families, ported from movement-
//! engine `services/run_host/{rules,drain,lease}.ts`: what a park writes and
//! in which order, when a run counts as complete, how a run that failed or
//! was cancelled is torn down, how a race's losing subtrees are withdrawn,
//! how a parked run's leaves are stepped (claimed, stepped, finished, with
//! deferred races settled once at the end), and the per-run lease every
//! entry into a run holds.
//!
//! Callback-backed awaits are kept by crate::callbacks, not here.
