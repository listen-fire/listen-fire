//! Local module processes (Henry 2026-10-19, "local module processes"): a
//! module's process starts the first time a run or a check needs it, stays
//! up while it is used, and stops after an idle period, or as soon as no
//! file set holds it any more (`Hold`: no movement imports it); one that
//! crashed starts again on its next use. Trusted modules (first-party `@lf/*`, or
//! `trusted: true` in their install) share one Node host, each under its own
//! path; any other module gets a process of its own, never shared.
//!
//! A host is started from a `Launch` and answers with its address; how that
//! address is learned (`spawn`) is the one place that knows the transport
//! (crate::module_transport): a Unix socket where the system has them, else
//! loopback TCP. A host keeps one socket path for its life, so a restarted
//! process answers where the first one did (a module lf handed the browser
//! slot's address to still reaches it).
//!
//! Every started process is told to exit with lf (`LF_EXIT_WITH_PARENT`:
//! lf holds its stdin), and is recorded through the store slot so the next
//! lf on the same machine stops what a killed lf left behind (`track_in`).
