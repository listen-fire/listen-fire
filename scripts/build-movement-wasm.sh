# Rebuilds the two committed movement artifacts and prints each one's sha256
# and size:
#
#  - movement.wasm, from crates/movement-engine (which links in
#    crates/movement-parser): the parser and the engine, which the API loads;
#  - movement_parser.wasm, from crates/movement-parser alone: the parser, the
#    lowering and the catalog, which the browser loads (it never runs a
#    movement, so it never downloads the engine).
#
# CI (.github/workflows/movement-wasm.yml) runs this and fails if either
# differs from what is committed, so commit both with any change to either
# crate, the lockfile, the profile or the toolchain.
#
# Two things differ on a macOS machine, and the script handles both so a
# rebuild there reproduces CI's bytes with no environment of its own:
#
#  - the pinned toolchain's `rust-lld` cannot find `libLLVM.dylib` (it looks
#    beside itself; the library sits in the toolchain's `lib`), so linking
#    fails. On macOS the build links through a `rust-lld` wrapper that sets
#    DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (macOS drops that variable on its way into a script,
#    so only a wrapper can set it for the linker).
#  - an installed `rust-src` component makes rustc name the standard
#    library's sources by their local path instead of `/rustc/<commit>`, and
#    panic strings carry that path into the artifact. The remap below maps it
#    back on every machine (where `rust-src` is absent, as on CI, it matches
#    nothing).

# The shadow stack goes first in linear memory (`--stack-first`, also rustc's
# default for this target) so an overflow traps instead of silently
# overwriting static data, and is 3 MiB: at the parser's depth limit
# (MAX_DEPTH in crates/movement-parser/src/lexer.rs) the deepest texts need
# between 512 and 768 KiB of it (measured 2026-10-06). The engine ends a run
# with its coded error when less than 1 MiB is left (crates/movement-engine/src/deep.rs),
# and that megabyte is on top of the 2 MiB this stack was before, so a run that
# fitted in those still does.
