# Dev-loop boot: bring up the full stack with fakes wired in.
#
# Profiles are controlled by $DEV_LOOP_PROFILE (or the wrapper script you
# invoke). Each profile reserves its own port range so multiple stacks can
# run in parallel:
#
#   (per profile: api=base, web=base+3, admin=base+4; fake-channels in its
#    own pair.)
#   default — the primary local stack. api 3000, web 3003, admin 3004, fake-channels 5556.
#   agent   — first agent stack. api 3500 … admin 3504, 6055, 6056.
#   agent2  — second agent stack. api 4000 … admin 4004, 6155, 6156.
#   agent3  — third agent stack. api 4500 … admin 4504, 6255, 6256.
#
# Postgres + Redis are shared single docker containers across all profiles.
# Profile state is recorded in .dev-loop/profiles/<profile>.json so that
# out-of-band dev CLIs can pick the right stack, and `pnpm dev:loop:status`
# can list / prune dead loops.
#
# Flags:
#   --force-kill     If any of this profile's ports are already bound, kill
#                    the holders and continue. Default is to abort.
#
# Reads .env from apps/api (which already includes TEST_HARNESS_TEAM_ID).
# See docs/dev-loop.md for the surrounding workflow.
