# The adapter protocol

Version: 2

A remote adapter connects a system you run to Listen-Fire. It is an HTTP
server you host, in any language. Listen-Fire calls it to learn your data
model, to read and write your records, and to wait on things that happen in
your system. Your server calls Listen-Fire back when something happens.

This document is the contract. The source of truth is the zod schema in
`packages/engine-contracts/protocol.ts`; where this page
and the schema disagree, the schema wins. The reference adapter is the fake
CRM, a single file in lf-platform, `apps/api/src/scripts/dev/fake_crm_adapter.ts` (see
[Build your first adapter](#build-your-first-adapter)).

## The envelope

Every call is a `POST` of JSON to one URL, your `baseUrl`. The method name is
in the body, not the path.

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": "2",
  "method": "describe",
  "cacheScopeId": "c0ffee",
  "params": { "typeId": "Company" }
}
```

- `protocolVersion` is the string `"2"`.
- `cacheScopeId` is opaque. You may scope a per-call cache by it, or ignore it.
- `params` is the method's input (see [Methods](#methods)).

You answer with HTTP 200 and one of two bodies:

```json
{ "ok": true, "result": { "typeId": "Company", "displayName": "Company", "fields": [], "references": [] } }
```

```json
{ "ok": false, "error": { "code": "adapter_error", "message": "CRM timed out", "retryable": true } }
```

- An application failure is still HTTP 200, with `ok: false`.
- Non-200 is for transport faults only: 401 when authentication fails, 400 when
  the body is not a request envelope. Listen-Fire treats any non-2xx as a
  transport error, marked retryable (see [Limits](#limits-and-timeouts) for
  what that does today).
- Listen-Fire validates every `result` against the method's schema. A wrong
  shape fails the call and names the method and the offending path.

Types, fields and edges each have two names, and the two may differ:

- `typeId` (and a field's `fieldId`) is your own id. Listen-Fire hands a
  `typeId` back to `describe` and reads it in a reference's `targetTypeId`.
  Keep it stable.
- `displayName` (a reference's `name`, for an edge) is the natural name.
  Automations write it (`crm-[:Company]->`), and every other call names the
  type, field or edge by it: `recordType: "Company"`, the keys of `fields`,
  `edge: "Comments"`. It is not just presentation: renaming it breaks the
  saved automations that use it.
- `describe` may be asked by either name, so accept both. Simplest: give each
  type one name and use it for both.

Record ids are identity, and cross the wire unchanged.

## Transport

Every module kind — adapter, plugin, and every core slot (store, models, judge, files, limiter, loopGuard, browser) — is reached this one way: this envelope over HTTP. Where it listens decides how:

| where the module runs | its address | how |
|---|---|---|
| on the host's box, started by the host | `unix:<socket path>` | HTTP/1.1 on a Unix socket |
| on the host's box, where there are no sockets | `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` | loopback TCP |
| elsewhere (a remote module: only a manifest on the host) | `https://…` | HTTPS |

- **A module the host starts** is told where to listen: `MODULE_SOCKET` (a socket path) when set, else `PORT` (`0` picks one). It requires `Authorization: Bearer <MODULE_TOKEN>` when that is set, and prints one line on its stdout once it answers: `listening unix:<socket path>`, or `listening <port>`.
- **A URL below a socket** (a file a module serves) is `http+unix://<socket path, percent-encoded>/<path>`.
- **A remote module** is an `lf-external.yaml` with `url:` (and `auth:` naming the install field holding its secret). A credential goes only over HTTPS, a socket or loopback.
- **Outgoing auth.** A remote module behind a platform's own sign-in (Cloud Run with IAM, a proxy) is reached with a second credential, set per install: `outgoing_auth: google-identity` sends a Google identity token for `outgoing_audience` (default: the URL's origin), minted by the metadata server; `outgoing_auth: bearer` sends `outgoing_token`. It goes in `outgoing_header`, by default `authorization`, or `x-serverless-authorization` when the module's own secret holds `authorization`. The module never sees these fields as settings.

## Versioning

- A request carries `"protocolVersion": "2"`. A server built on the reference
  kit answers any other version with the error code `protocol_version`.
- Your `manifest` answer carries `"protocolVersion": 2` (a number).
- Installing probes your server: Listen-Fire calls `manifest` with the secret
  and refuses the install unless it answers `protocolVersion: 2`.
- An install made before its secret is supplied stores the version the
  manifest file claims. The probe runs when the secret is linked.
- Additions that older servers can ignore (a new optional field, a new
  optional method) do not change the version. A change in meaning does.
- Within a version, the two sides learn what the other speaks from the
  manifest, never from the version: a method is called only when it is listed
  in `methods`, and a declaration (`credentials`, `inbound`, `poll`,
  `periodic`) is acted on only when it is present. An older server sends
  neither and is unchanged; an older host ignores both.
- The version is an integer on the manifest and its decimal string on a
  request. `MANIFEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION` and `PROTOCOL_VERSION`
  (`packages/engine-contracts/protocol.ts`) hold it, and a test holds them
  equal to the version at the top of this page. [The contracts
  index](README.md) lists what each release supports.

## Authentication

Listen-Fire sends your secret on every call. Your manifest picks how:

| `authStrategy` | Header Listen-Fire sends |
|---|---|
| `{ "kind": "bearer" }` | `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` |
| `{ "kind": "shared_secret" }` | `x-listen-fire-adapter-secret: <secret>` |
| `{ "kind": "shared_secret", "header": "x-acme-key" }` | `x-acme-key: <secret>` |

- Check the header on every request; answer HTTP 401 when it is missing or wrong.
- The secret is entered at install time and stored encrypted. It never goes in
  the manifest.
- The secret belongs to the INSTALL: every call to your server carries it,
  whichever user the call acts as. Who the call acts as at your provider
  rides separately, as the request's `credential`
  ([Credentials](#credentials)).
- Every call to your server carries `x-listen-fire-team: <team id>`, the UUID of
  the team whose install is calling. A server that serves several teams learns
  from it which one. It is not a credential: authenticate by the secret.
- When your server calls Listen-Fire (the push doors), it sends the same secret.
  The team header is optional there; send it only to disambiguate a secret
  shared across teams. See [the doors](#the-two-doors-you-call).

## The manifest and installing

The manifest file registers your server with a team:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": 2,
  "adapterType": "acme_crm",
  "displayName": "Acme CRM",
  "description": "Our internal CRM.",
  "baseUrl": "https://crm.acme.example/listen-fire",
  "authStrategy": { "kind": "bearer" },
  "supportedTriggers": ["webhook"],
  "runtimeCapabilities": {
    "traversal": { "incoming": false, "edgeProperties": false },
    "resources": false
  },
  "methods": [
    "listEntryPoints", "describe", "resolveEntity", "getFieldValue", "getRelated",
    "iterateRelatedPage", "createRecord", "updateRecord", "deleteRecord",
    "preprocessInbound", "listEventTypes", "wakeKeys", "resolveAwait",
    "ensureEventSubscription", "removeEventSubscription"
  ]
}
```

- `adapterType` is the slug an automation imports (`import { acme_crm } from adapters`). One install per slug per team. Charset: `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$` (ASCII lower case).
  It may not be a name a built-in adapter answers to (`slack`, `gmail`,
  `inbound_email`, `kg_mutation`, …, in any casing), nor `callback` or `ask`:
  the install is refused.
- `methods` lists exactly what you implement. Listen-Fire never calls an
  optional method you did not list.
- The file is what Listen-Fire uses. Installing calls your `manifest` method
  only to check its `protocolVersion` and its shape; `methods`,
  `supportedTriggers` and `runtimeCapabilities` come from the file. Keep the
  two answers the same.
- `supportedTriggers` is `["webhook"]` if your system announces events, else `[]`.
- `description` (optional): one or two sentences about your system. An
  author's editor shows it when they hover your adapter or a connection to it.
- Optional fields: `handbookSection` (`{ title, content }`, prose the authoring
  handbook shows about your system), `vocabulary` (an icon and event phrasing),
  `webhookEventTypeId`.
- Optional module declarations: `credentials`, `inbound`, `poll` and
  `periodic` ([Modules](#modules-credentials-signatures-and-schedules)).
- What a listen on your adapter may say, also optional:
  - `subscribableEvents`: the values of a listen's `events: [...]`
    (`listen to crm { events: ["company.created"] } fire welcome`). An event
    is routed to that listen only when its `eventType` is one of them.
  - `defaultSubscribedEvents`: what a listen with no `events` receives
    (absent means every subscribable event).
  - `listenConfig`: further keys, as `[{ key, required?, format? }]`, where
    `format` is `cron`, `timezone`, `fields` or `strings`.
  Declare them and the checker refuses any other key or event. Declare none
  and a listen's config goes unchecked.

Install it on the **Adapters** page, pasting the manifest and the secret
together. An agent can instead give the user a link to enter the secret
out of band.

## Methods

Required: `manifest`, `listEntryPoints`, `describe`, `resolveEntity`,
`getFieldValue`, `getRelated`, `createRecord`, `updateRecord`, `deleteRecord`.
A pure sink returns `null` and `[]` from the reads; a read-only source can
throw from the writes. Everything else is optional and declared in `methods`.

Each example shows `params` → `result` (the `result` inside `ok: true`).

### manifest

`{}` → the same declarations as the manifest file:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": 2,
  "adapterType": "acme_crm",
  "supportedTriggers": ["webhook"],
  "runtimeCapabilities": { "traversal": { "incoming": false, "edgeProperties": false }, "resources": false },
  "methods": [
    "listEntryPoints", "describe", "resolveEntity", "getFieldValue", "getRelated",
    "iterateRelatedPage", "createRecord", "updateRecord", "deleteRecord",
    "preprocessInbound", "listEventTypes", "wakeKeys", "resolveAwait",
    "ensureEventSubscription", "removeEventSubscription"
  ]
}
```

The hosted product reads only `protocolVersion` from it (see
[installing](#the-manifest-and-installing)). `lf`, which has no manifest file,
reads every declaration from it, the listen declarations included.

`webhookEventTypeId` (a string) is optional.

### listEntryPoints

`{}` → the types an automation can start from:

```json
[
  { "typeId": "Company", "displayName": "Company", "writable": true, "readable": false, "fires": true,
    "description": "A company. A listen is delivered each one somebody creates in the CRM." },
  { "typeId": "Comment", "displayName": "Comment", "writable": false, "readable": false }
]
```

- `writable`: automations may create this type.
- `readable`: automations may enumerate it from the root.
- `fires`: a listen is delivered records of this type (see
  [emit](#emit-new-data)). An event type is usually `readable: false`: it is
  pushed, never listed.
- Publish every type your edges reach, even one only reached along an edge
  (`Comment` above), so it is named.
- `description` (optional): what a record of this type is. An author's
  editor leads with it when they hover the type, a walk to it or a
  parameter holding one. A `description` on the type's `describe` answer
  wins over this one.

### describe

`{ "typeId": "Company" }` → one type, or `null` if unknown:

```json
{
  "typeId": "Company",
  "displayName": "Company",
  "fields": [
    { "fieldId": "Name", "displayName": "Name", "kind": "string", "writable": true, "required": true,
      "description": "The company's legal name." },
    { "fieldId": "Description", "displayName": "Description", "kind": "string", "writable": true, "required": false }
  ],
  "references": [
    { "fieldId": "Comments", "name": "Comments", "targetTypeId": "Comment", "cardinality": "many",
      "direction": "outgoing", "writable": false, "awaitable": true, "watchable": true, "resolvesEmpty": true,
      "description": "What people said about the company, oldest first." }
  ]
}
```

- A field's `kind` is one of `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `date`,
  `file`, `json` or `enum` (with `enumValues`), or `reference` (an edge, not
  a value). A field with any other `kind` is silently dropped, and the
  type's position is then left open: automations may read any field name
  off it unchecked. Add `"cardinality": "many"` for a list.
- Fields and references pass through with whatever extra keys you declare.
  On a reference Listen-Fire reads:
  - `readable` — defaults to true; `false` marks a write-only edge;
  - `writable` — only an explicit `true` allows creating along the edge;
    absent means read-only;
  - `awaitable`, `watchable`, `resolvesEmpty` (see
    [awaits](#waiting-on-your-system-awaits)).
- `description` (optional) on the type, a field or a reference: what it is,
  in a sentence. An author's editor shows it when they hover the record, the
  field or the walk along the reference. A write-only field's description is
  also quoted when an automation tries to read it, so say there where the
  value can be read instead.
- `deletable` (optional, on the type): `true` says your `deleteRecord`
  removes a record of this type. Absent means no. A `delete` of a type that does not say `"deletable": true`
  is refused before the automation is saved (`MOV_DELETE_NOT_DECLARED`);
  automations pinned to an earlier version are unaffected.
- `edgesFrom` (optional) replaces `describe` for nested systems: `{ position, cursor? }`
  → `{ descriptor, targetPositions?, nextCursor? }` or `null`. The adapter
  handbook's schema chapter covers it.

### resolveEntity

Decides whether a record Listen-Fire is about to write already exists.

```json
{
  "record": { "Name": "Vireo Robotics" },
  "recordType": "Company",
  "candidates": [],
  "constraints": { "any": [ { "all": [ { "field": "Name" } ] } ] }
}
```
→
```json
{ "candidates": [ { "adapterType": "acme_crm", "externalId": "company-7", "recordType": "Company", "data": { "Name": "Vireo Robotics" } } ] }
```

Return `{ "candidates": [] }` when nothing matches; Listen-Fire then creates.

### getFieldValue

```json
{
  "position": { "adapterType": "acme_crm", "recordType": "Company",
                "identity": { "kind": "stable", "recordId": "company-7", "data": { "Name": "Vireo Robotics" } } },
  "fieldId": "Name"
}
```
→ `"Vireo Robotics"` (any JSON value, or `null`).

A position is how Listen-Fire hands a record back to you: the `recordType`,
your `recordId`, and the `data` you attached when you returned it. Read from
`data` when you can; it saves a call to your system.

A position an automation produced, rather than read from you, also carries
`originRef` (its `kind` is `extract`, `transform` or `resource`) and may carry
`evidence` and `resources`. You may ignore all three. A file ref inside them
is in the wire's spelling ([Files](#files)): its owner type and handle, never
Listen-Fire's credential or construction args.

### getRelated

```json
{
  "position": { "adapterType": "acme_crm", "recordType": "Company", "identity": { "kind": "stable", "recordId": "company-7" } },
  "fieldId": "Comments",
  "direction": "outgoing"
}
```
→
```json
[ { "position": { "adapterType": "acme_crm", "recordType": "Comment",
                  "identity": { "kind": "stable", "recordId": "comment-1", "data": { "Text": "approved" } } } } ]
```

- Every position you return must name its `recordType`; a typeless one is rejected.
- `where`, `orderBy` and `limit` may arrive as hints. You may ignore them;
  Listen-Fire applies them again.
- For a large collection, implement [`iterateRelatedPage`](#paging) too.

### createRecord

```json
{
  "recordType": "Company",
  "fields": { "Name": "Vireo Robotics" },
  "mutationContext": { "source": { "type": "structured_input" }, "occurredAt": "2026-10-07T09:54:31Z" },
  "parentLinks": [ { "recordType": "Deal", "externalId": "d_1", "edgeName": "Company" } ]
}
```
→
```json
{ "adapterType": "acme_crm", "externalId": "company-1", "recordType": "Company", "data": { "Name": "Vireo Robotics" } }
```

- `fields` is keyed by your field display names.
- `parentLinks` (optional) are parents to attach the new record to, along the named edge.
  A link may carry `data`: the parent's own payload, in its adapter's shape.
- Optional inputs: `evidence` (per field), `resources`, `bridgeToExternal`.
- The `data` you return is what an automation reads off the written record,
  and what [`resolveAwait`](#waiting-on-your-system-awaits) later receives as `headData`.
- Optional outputs: `url`, `events`.

### updateRecord

The `createRecord` input plus `externalId` →

```json
{ "adapterType": "acme_crm", "externalId": "company-1", "recordType": "Company", "data": { "Name": "Vireo" }, "association": "none" }
```

- If the record is gone, return `{ "notFound": true }`; do not throw.
- `association` says what became of the `parentLinks`: `made`, `already`,
  `unsupported` (you cannot attach an existing record along that edge) or
  `none` (no parent was named). Omitted, it reads as `unsupported`.

### deleteRecord

`{ "recordType": "Company", "externalId": "company-1", "mutationContext": { … } }` → `{}` (optionally `{ "events": [] }`).

Asked only for a type whose descriptor says `"deletable": true`: under
an automation cannot delete any other.

### Optional methods

| Method | params | result |
|---|---|---|
| `iterateRelatedPage` | `getRelated` params + `cursor?` | `{ items, nextCursor? }` ([Paging](#paging)) |
| `resolveAwait` | `{ recordId, edge, headData? }` | `pending` / `landed` / `empty` ([awaits](#waiting-on-your-system-awaits)) |
| `wakeKeys` | `{ raw }` | `string[]` ([awaits](#waiting-on-your-system-awaits)) |
| `preprocessInbound` | `{ raw, checkpoint? }` | `{ events, checkpoint? }` — **required** to receive webhooks through the [host door](#inbound-through-the-host-door) |
| `listEventTypes` | `{}` | `[{ tag, positionType, match? }]` |
| `ensureEventSubscription` | `{ events, callbackUrl, current?, scope? }` | `{ externalId?, secret }` |
| `removeEventSubscription` | `{ callbackUrl, externalId?, scope? }` | `null` |
| `readRecord` | `{ recordType, externalId, fieldIds? }` | the record's fields, or `null` (lets an update with no changes be skipped) |
| `linkRecords` / `unlinkRecords` | `{ from: { recordType, externalId }, edgeName, to: { … }, mutationContext }` | `{ created }` / `{ removed }` |
| `resolveFileRef` | `{ ref }` | `{ url, contentType? }` ([Files](#files)) |
| `translateFilter` | `{ expression, entityType }` | `{ native, residual }` |
| `getDedupRules` | `{ typeRef }` | `{ constraints }` or `null` |
| `getActorCandidates` | `{ event }` | `[{ identity, source }]` |
| `extractActor` | `{ event }` | an actor identity, or `null` |
| `describeOpaqueId` | `{ fieldPath, value }` | a label, or `null` |
| `invokeFieldFunction` | `{ recordType, fieldId, functionName, args: { instructions, data } }` | the composed value |
| `edgesFrom` | `{ position, cursor? }` | see [describe](#describe) |
| `poll` | `{ config, checkpoint? }` | `{ events, checkpoint? }` ([Modules](#polled-sources-and-periodic-tasks)); needs `poll` declared |
| `refreshCredential` | `{}` | `{ fields }` ([Modules](#credentials)); needs `credentials` declared |
| `runPeriodic` | `{ name }` | `null` ([Modules](#polled-sources-and-periodic-tasks)); needs `periodic` declared |
| `checkInbound` | `{ request, secret?, checkpoint? }` | `accepted` / `refused` / `reply` ([Modules](#a-module-that-checks-its-own-inbound)); needs `inbound.scheme: module` |

`listEventTypes` example — the CRM's one event, delivered as a `Company`:

```json
[ { "tag": "company.created", "positionType": "Company" } ]
```

## Waiting on your system (awaits)

An automation can wait for something to happen in your system:

```
c = write crm-[:Company]-> { Name: "Vireo Robotics" }
r = await FIRST(c-[:Comments]->)
```

The run stops at the `await` and resumes when a comment arrives. Listen-Fire
owns all the waiting state. Your server answers two questions: "has it
happened yet, and if not, what key will you wake it with?" (`resolveAwait`)
and "which keys does this event wake?" (`wakeKeys` or the `wake` door).

### Declaring an awaitable edge

On the reference in `describe`:

- `awaitable: true` — automations may `await` it.
- `watchable: true` — you will wake waiting runs (through `wake` or a delivery
  to the host door). Without it, `await FIRST(…)` is refused when the
  automation is saved, and the author is told to poll instead.
- `resolvesEmpty: true` — the wait can end with nothing (for example, the
  record was deleted). Then what follows the `await` runs zero times.

### resolveAwait

```json
{ "recordId": "company-1", "edge": "Comments", "headData": { "Name": "Vireo Robotics" } }
```

- `recordId` is the `externalId` you returned when the record was written.
- `headData` is the `data` you returned with it, when there was any.

Answer one of three:

```json
{ "status": "pending", "correlationKey": "thread:company-1" }
```

```json
{ "status": "landed", "correlationKey": "thread:company-1",
  "landings": [ { "recordId": "comment-1", "recordType": "Comment", "fields": { "Text": "approved" } } ] }
```

```json
{ "status": "empty" }
```

- `pending`: nothing yet. `correlationKey` is required: it is the key you
  will later wake with. Listen-Fire stores the key against the waiting run.
- `landed`: here is what arrived. `correlationKey` is required here too: if
  no landing passes the automation's `WHERE`, the run keeps waiting on it.
- `empty`: the wait is over with nothing, and what follows the `await` runs
  zero times. Only on an edge declared `resolvesEmpty`. Listen-Fire does not
  yet enforce this: an `empty` on any other edge is bound anyway, and its
  downstream silently runs zero times where the author never planned for it.
  Never return it there.
- Each landing's `fields` are read back through your `getFieldValue` for its
  `recordType`, so key them the way your positions' `data` is keyed.
- The first landing that passes the `WHERE` wins.

When Listen-Fire calls it:

- once at the `await`;
- once more right after the run is parked, so a wake that arrived between the
  two is not lost;
- again on every wake for the run's key.

Make it a cheap, current read of your system. It must be safe to call any
number of times.

### Waking a run

Wake by key, two ways:

- push the keys yourself: `POST …/wake` ([the doors](#the-two-doors-you-call));
- or, if Listen-Fire receives your webhooks ([host door](#inbound-through-the-host-door)),
  implement `wakeKeys`: `{ "raw": <the delivery body> }` → `["thread:company-1"]`.
  Listen-Fire calls it for every delivery, whether or not the delivery also
  carries events. If `wakeKeys` fails, the delivery's events are still
  receipted and queued, and the delivery is answered 500 so you send it
  again; the resend replays the events without running them twice and
  retries the wakes.

**Commit before you wake.** A wake makes Listen-Fire call `resolveAwait` for
the key at once. If the landing is not yet visible to that read (still in an
open transaction, or on a replica that lags), the run parks again on
`pending` and nothing follows: no second wake comes unless you send one.

A wake for a key nobody is waiting on does nothing. A run woken early simply
calls `resolveAwait` again and parks again on `pending`.

Cancelling a waiting run is Listen-Fire's alone: it drops its key. A later
wake for that key finds nothing.

## Telling Listen-Fire something happened

There are two ways in. Use whichever fits your system:

- **You push** to the two doors (`emit`, `wake`). Simplest: no subscription,
  no signatures.
- **Listen-Fire subscribes** to you and you deliver webhooks to the URL it
  gives you (the host door). Use this when your system already sends webhooks.

The two are independent and unordered. Nothing relies on a wake arriving
before or after an event.

### The two doors you call

```
POST {listen-fire}/api/public/adapter/{adapterType}/emit   { "events": [ … ] }
POST {listen-fire}/api/public/adapter/{adapterType}/wake   { "keys": [ … ] }
```

Authentication:

- Send the same header, with the same secret, that Listen-Fire sends you (your
  `authStrategy`). The install whose secret matches is the team.
- You never name the team, except with the optional `x-listen-fire-team`
  header (the same header, and the same team id, Listen-Fire sends on every
  call to you). Use it when one secret serves several teams' installs of your
  adapter: it narrows the lookup to that team. Its value must be the team's
  id, a UUID; anything else is answered 401 with no further detail.

Answers:

| Status | Body | When |
|---|---|---|
| 202 | `{ "accepted": n }` | queued |
| 400 | `{ "error": "bad_request", "issues": [{ "path", "message" }] }` | malformed body |
| 401 | `{ "error": "unauthorized" }` | the secret matches no install of this type, the type is not installed, the named team has no matching install, or the type is a name a built-in adapter answers to |
| 409 | `{ "error": "ambiguous_credential", "message" }` | the secret matches installs on several teams and no `x-listen-fire-team` was sent |
| 413 | | the body is over 1 MB |
| 500 | `{ "error": "capture_failed", "accepted", "failed" }` | some events could not be receipted (see below) |
| 500 | `{ "error": "internal" }` | retry later |

- Authentication is checked before the body, so an unauthenticated caller
  learns nothing about the body's shape.
- 401 is the only refusal for anything unauthenticated: never 404.
- A body carries 1 to 1,000 events or keys, in at most 1 MB of JSON
  (`content-type: application/json`).
- Delivery is at least once. Retry on 5xx or a network failure.
- A `capture_failed` 500 on `emit` is partial: the events counted in
  `accepted` were receipted and queued before the 500. Since `emit` is not
  idempotent, resending the whole batch runs those again. Resend only the
  events that failed, or accept the duplicate runs.

#### emit: new data

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "payload": { "id": "company-3", "Name": "Larch Bio" },
      "externalId": "company-3",
      "tag": "company.created",
      "eventType": "company.created",
      "changeType": "create",
      "recordType": "Company"
    }
  ]
}
```

- Each event is matched against the team's listens on your adapter, exactly
  as a webhook delivery's events are. `tag` is matched against your
  `listEventTypes` to decide the event's type.
- `payload` is what the automation reads: it becomes the delivered record's
  data, read through your `getFieldValue`.
- Every field but `payload` is optional; there are also `actor`,
  `occurredAt` and `changedFields`.
- `accepted` counts receipts: one per listen the event matched. An event no
  listen selects is accepted as 0 and leaves nothing behind.
- One malformed event fails the whole request with 400; nothing is queued.
- `deliveryId` (optional, a non-empty string, else 400 at path `deliveryId`)
  names the batch. The host keeps the batch as one delivery; a second batch
  with the same `deliveryId` from the same adapter is kept out and answered
  202 `{ accepted: 0, duplicate: true }`. `lf` honours it from this release;
  the hosted platform honours it from its own release. Without `deliveryId`,
  `emit` is not idempotent: sending an event twice runs its automations twice
  (an event's `idempotencyKey` still dedupes per listen).
- While your request is open, Listen-Fire calls you back (`listEventTypes`).
  A single-threaded server must not block on its own push.

#### wake: resume waiting runs

```json
{ "keys": ["thread:company-1"] }
```

- `accepted` is the number of keys queued. A key nobody waits on is accepted
  and does nothing.

### Inbound through the host door

If your system sends webhooks, let Listen-Fire subscribe:

1. While any automation listens to your adapter, Listen-Fire calls
   `ensureEventSubscription` on every reconcile of the team's listens (each
   time an automation is saved or deleted), even when nothing changed:

   ```json
   { "events": [], "callbackUrl": "https://listen-fire.example/api/public/webhook-sync/acme_crm/5f0c…" }
   ```
   →
   ```json
   { "externalId": "crm-sub-1", "secret": "8c1d…" }
   ```

   - `events` is the selection. An empty selection means every event you offer.
   - Make it an idempotent upsert. `current` (the previous `externalId` and
     `events`) arrives when a subscription already exists; update it rather
     than adding another.
   - Return the same secret to keep it. A different secret rotates it:
     Listen-Fire stores it and verifies the next delivery with it.
   - Being asked again is how a subscription you lost (a restart, a wiped
     store) comes back.
   - Treat `callbackUrl` as opaque. It is stable for the install.
   - `secret` is required. Without one the subscription is refused, withdrawn
     (`removeEventSubscription`), and reported as a problem when the automation
     is saved.

2. Deliver each webhook as a `POST` to `callbackUrl`, signed:

   ```
   x-listen-fire-signature: <lowercase hex HMAC-SHA256 of the exact raw body, keyed by the secret>
   ```

   The body is your own format, sent as `content-type: application/json`, at
   most 100 KB. Listen-Fire answers:

   | Status | When |
   |---|---|
   | 200 `{ "ok": true, "eventsProcessed": n }` | accepted |
   | 400 `{ "error": "provider_mismatch" }` | the URL's adapter segment does not match the subscription |
   | 401 `{ "error": "signature_invalid" }` | bad or missing signature |
   | 404 `{ "error": "subscription_not_found" }` | unknown or deleted subscription |
   | 500 | your adapter does not implement `preprocessInbound`; `wakeKeys` failed or its wakes could not be queued (the events are already receipted: send the delivery again); or an internal failure |

3. While your delivery is open, Listen-Fire calls you back:
   `preprocessInbound({ raw })` turns your body into events, `wakeKeys({ raw })`
   turns it into keys, and `listEventTypes` types the events. A
   single-threaded server must not block on its own delivery.

   ```json
   { "raw": { "companies": [ { "id": "company-3", "Name": "Larch Bio" } ] } }
   ```
   →
   ```json
   { "events": [ { "payload": { "id": "company-3", "Name": "Larch Bio" }, "externalId": "company-3", "tag": "company.created" } ] }
   ```

   `checkpoint` is optional: whatever you return is handed back on the next delivery.

4. When no listen needs the subscription any more, Listen-Fire calls
   `removeEventSubscription`.

Protocol 2 has no replay protection: a captured signed delivery verifies
again. Keep the callback on HTTPS.

## Modules: credentials, signatures and schedules

An installable module (a built-in integration such as `@lf/attio`, or your
own server) can hand its housekeeping to the host by declaring it in the
manifest. Every declaration is optional and is an addition within version 2:
a server that declares nothing is unchanged.

A declaration and its method go together. The manifest is refused when one
is present without the other (`poll` with the `poll` method, `periodic` with
`runPeriodic`, `plugins` with `invokePlugin`), or when a name is declared
twice. `refreshCredential` needs
`credentials`, but `credentials` does not need `refreshCredential`.

### Credentials

Declare the credential your module needs to reach its provider. Several
declarations are ALTERNATIVES (Gmail sign-in or a service account): a
connection uses exactly one (`connect gmail using alice_gmail`), and the host
sends only that one. A module that needs two secrets at once declares them as
two fields of one credential:

```json
"credentials": [
  {
    "name": "attio",
    "kind": "oauth2",
    "fields": [{ "name": "workspace_id", "label": "Workspace", "secret": false }],
    "oauth2": {
      "authorizeUrl": "https://app.attio.com/authorize",
      "tokenUrl": "https://app.attio.com/oauth/token",
      "scopes": ["record_permission:read-write"],
      "clientAuth": "body",
      "pkce": true
    }
  }
]
```

- `name` is ASCII lower case. It names the credential in `lf.yaml`, a connect
  link and the request.
- `kind` is `static` or `oauth2`:
  - `static` is entered once and never refreshed by the host (an API key, a
    bot token). It holds exactly its `fields`.
  - `oauth2` is connected through the provider's authorize page. It holds
    `access_token`, `refresh_token` and `expires_at` (an ISO time) besides its
    `fields`, and needs the `oauth2` block.
- Each field is `{ name, label?, secret?, optional? }`. A field is secret
  unless it says `"secret": false`: the host keeps secret fields out of logs,
  traces and error text.
- `oauth2`: `authorizeUrl` and `tokenUrl` (required), `scopes`, `clientAuth`
  (`basic`, the default, sends the client id and secret as an HTTP Basic
  header on the token call; `body` sends them in the form), `pkce`, and
  `authorizeParams` (extra query parameters for the authorize page).

Your server's secret belongs to the install; a declared credential belongs to
the CONNECTION. One install serves many users: a movement connects once per
account, naming the credential each connection acts as,

```
hs_alice = connect hubspot using alice_hubspot
hs_bob = connect hubspot using bob_hubspot
```

and every call made through `hs_alice` is signed with the install's secret
and carries Alice's credential, every call through `hs_bob` Bob's. The host
binds each stored credential to one module and one of its declared
credentials (the platform's credential row; lf's `module:` + `credential:`
secrets entry), and refuses at check a connection naming a credential bound
to another module, or to a credential the module does not declare. The OAuth
app you register at your provider (its client id and secret) belongs to the
install too, and stays with the host, which refreshes with it.

The host sends the connection's credential on every request, beside
`params`:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": "2",
  "method": "poll",
  "cacheScopeId": "c0ffee",
  "params": { "config": {} },
  "credential": { "name": "attio", "fields": { "access_token": "…", "refresh_token": "…", "expires_at": "2026-10-17T12:00:00.000Z" } }
}
```

- Every field value is a string.
- The fields sent are the ones the declaration names, plus `access_token`,
  `refresh_token` and `expires_at` for an `oauth2` one. Anything else the host
  keeps beside them (its client secret, say) is never sent.
- `credential` is the one the connection names, under the declared
  credential it fills. Never more than one: the request has no `credentials`
  list (an older host that sends one is ignored). A module that declares none
  is sent none.
- The host sends a credential only to an installed module that declares it,
  and only over loopback or HTTPS.
- Never log it, echo it in an error, or store it beyond the call.

If your call changed the credential (you refreshed the token, or the provider
rotated the refresh token), say so beside the result:

```json
{ "ok": true, "result": { "events": [] }, "credentialUpdate": { "name": "attio", "fields": { "access_token": "…", "refresh_token": "…" } } }
```

- Only the fields you name change; the host merges them over the stored ones
  and writes them back to the credential the call carried (Alice's update
  lands on Alice's credential, never Bob's).
- Name only fields your declaration names (and the three token fields of an
  `oauth2` credential). An update naming any other field is refused, and the
  call fails.
- `credentialUpdate` may ride a failure (`ok: false`) too. Send it whenever a
  token changed, or a rotated refresh token is lost.

Refreshing:

- The host refreshes an `oauth2` credential itself, with the standard
  refresh-token grant at `tokenUrl` and the install's OAuth app, before a call
  when `expires_at` is near and once more when a call fails as unauthorized.
- A provider whose refresh is not the standard grant implements
  `refreshCredential`: `{}` → `{ fields }`, the changed fields. The credential
  to refresh is the request's `credential`.
- The host runs at most one refresh of a credential at a time, so two calls
  never spend the same refresh token.

### Declared inbound signatures

A module whose provider sends webhooks names how they are signed, and the
host verifies each delivery before `preprocessInbound` sees it:

```json
"inbound": {
  "providerKey": "attio",
  "scheme": "attio",
  "signatureHeaders": ["attio-signature", "x-attio-signature"]
}
```

- `providerKey` is the door's provider segment:
  `/api/public/webhook-sync/<providerKey>/<subscription>`. A built-in keeps
  today's key, so no subscription's URL changes.
- `scheme` is one of:

  | `scheme` | Provider |
  |---|---|
  | `hmac_sha256_hex` | lower-case hex HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body |
  | `airtable_mac` | Airtable's `x-airtable-content-mac` |
  | `attio` | Attio's signature |
  | `affinity_hex_or_b64` | Affinity's signature, hex or base64 |
  | `slack_v0` | Slack's `v0` signature over the timestamp and body |
  | `telegram_secret_token` | Telegram's secret token, compared whole |
  | `remote` | this protocol's own `x-listen-fire-signature` ([host door](#inbound-through-the-host-door)) |

- `signatureHeaders` lists the headers that may carry the signature, in lower
  case; the first one present is read. `slack_v0` also reads
  `x-slack-request-timestamp`, which the scheme fixes.
- `deliveryId` (optional) names the header that carries the provider's id for
  a delivery, `{ "header": "x-github-delivery" }` (lower case, as
  `signatureHeaders`). The host reads it before `preprocessInbound` and keeps
  a second delivery under the same id at the same subscription out: it answers
  200 `{ ok: true, duplicate: true, eventsProcessed: 0 }` and queues nothing.
  Without it every delivery is kept under an id the host mints, and none is a
  duplicate. Ignored for `scheme: module`, whose check names the id itself.
- `intercepts` (optional) names requests the host answers itself, unsigned,
  before verifying: `slack_url_verification` echoes Slack's `challenge`.
- `secretIssuedBy` (optional) says who sets the key deliveries are signed
  with. `installer`, the default: whoever installs the module sets it (`lf
  connect` generates one or takes the one typed). `provider`: the provider
  issues it when the webhook is registered, as `ensureEventSubscription`'s
  `secret`; nobody is asked for it, and a registration that returns none is
  refused (and withdrawn). Attio and Airtable issue theirs.
- One host rule for every scheme: a delivery is refused when the key it
  should be signed with is missing, blank or still the placeholder a
  subscription holds before its registration returns a secret, and when its
  signature is wrong. No scheme is lenient for a module (a built-in keeps its
  door's behaviour only until it moves onto a module manifest).
- A scheme or intercept the host does not know refuses the manifest; it is
  never silently left unverified. A provider no scheme fits checks its own
  requests ([below](#a-module-that-checks-its-own-inbound)).

### A module that checks its own inbound

A provider no scheme fits (Mailgun's form signature, Resend's Svix), or one
that needs a handshake answered (Meta's verification `GET`), is checked by the
module itself. The manifest says so, and lists `checkInbound`:

```json
"inbound": { "providerKey": "email", "scheme": "module" }
```

- No `signatureHeaders` and no `intercepts`. `secretIssuedBy` is as above.
- The door takes `POST` and `GET` for it (only `POST` for a declared scheme).
- The host hands each request to `checkInbound`, as it arrived, and sends what
  the module answers. It verifies nothing itself, and calls neither
  `preprocessInbound` nor `wakeKeys` for it.

```json
{
  "request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/api/public/webhook-sync/email/mail",
    "query": "",
    "headers": { "content-type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
    "body": "c2VuZGVyPWFkYSU0MGV4YW1wbGUuY29tJi4uLg=="
  },
  "secret": "key-3b2f…"
}
```

- `body` is the exact bytes, base64. Header names are lower case, each with
  its first value.
- `secret` is the subscription's key, present only when it is usable (not
  missing, blank or the placeholder before registration). Refuse when you
  need it and it is absent.
- `checkpoint` is what your last `accepted` answer returned.
- The request carries the install's credential, as any call does: the keys a
  check reads (a verify token, the API key a thin notification is fetched
  with).

The answer is one of three:

| `outcome` | Fields | The door answers |
|---|---|---|
| `accepted` | `events`, `wakeKeys?`, `checkpoint?`, `deliveryId?` | 200 `{ ok, eventsProcessed }` once the events and wakes are queued, as for any delivery; a non-empty `deliveryId` already kept at this subscription answers 200 `{ ok, duplicate: true, eventsProcessed: 0 }` and queues nothing |
| `refused` | `status?` (a 4xx) | `status`, default 401, `{ "error": "signature_invalid" }` |
| `reply` | `status`, `text?` or `json?` | exactly that: `text` as `text/plain`, `json` as JSON, neither as an empty body; nothing runs |

```json
{ "outcome": "reply", "status": 200, "text": "1158201444" }
```

A throw is an internal failure: the door answers 500 and the provider
retries. The module kit reads the request for you (`inboundRequest(input)`:
its bytes, text, JSON, form, query and headers) and builds the answers
(`accepted`, `refused`, `reply`).

### Polled sources and periodic tasks

A source with no webhooks is polled:

```json
"poll": { "intervalSeconds": 300 }
```

- The host calls `poll` every `intervalSeconds` for each listen on the
  module; a listen's own `every` overrides it.
- `poll`: `{ config, checkpoint? }` → `{ events, checkpoint? }`. `config` is
  the listen's options. `checkpoint` is whatever the previous poll returned,
  absent the first time. Each event has the `emit` door's shape
  ([emit](#emit-new-data)).
- Return only what is new since the checkpoint. A backfill is not a poll.

Housekeeping on a schedule, per install (renewing a webhook the provider
expires, say):

```json
"periodic": [{ "name": "renew_webhook", "intervalSeconds": 86400 }]
```

- The host calls `runPeriodic({ name })` every `intervalSeconds` for each
  install, with that install's credential. It answers `null`.

### Plugins

A module may serve plugins instead of (or as well as) an adapter: functions a
movement calls. It declares them as one package, which a program imports by
its tag:

```json
"plugins": {
  "package": "@lf/web",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "fetch-url",
      "spec": {
        "args": ["url", "email"],
        "priced": false,
        "argTypes": { "url": "text", "email": "text" },
        "requiredArgs": ["url"],
        "effects": { "reads": ["the web"] },
        "output": { "kind": "value", "type": "text" },
        "description": "The page at a URL, as text."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```
import { `@lf/web` as web } from plugins
page = web.fetchUrl(u)
```

- `package` is the tag, matched exactly and never parsed.
- Each plugin's `name` is its registered name; a program calls it by the
  camel case of it (`fetch-url` → `fetchUrl`). Two names that spell the same
  (`fetch-url`, `fetch_url`) are one plugin declared twice, and refused.
- `spec` is what the checker reads: the arguments a call may write, their
  types, the required ones, its effects, whether it may cost money
  (`priced`), what it hands back (`output`), the arguments a
  `through [ … ]` stage feeds it (`fedArgs`), and `fedByExtraction` for a
  plugin that only reads what the stage extracted. Its optional
  `description` says what the plugin does; an author's editor shows it when
  they hover a call.
- `plugins` pairs with the method `invokePlugin`:
  `{ name, config, extractedContext }` → `{ text?, data?, records?, outcome?, costMicrodollars?, files?, warnings? }`.
  `config` is the author's arguments by name; `extractedContext` the fields
  extracted so far inside a stage (empty otherwise). The answer is what the
  plugin added: fetched `text` to extract from, `data` fields, `records` (one
  per thing it fetched, for a records output), an `outcome` for the trace,
  and what its own work cost that nothing else priced.
- **`files`** (a plugin that makes a file): `{ "<field>": { name?, contentType?, base64 } }`.
  Bytes do not ride the envelope as a URL a plugin could serve, so the plugin
  hands them over inline and the host stores each file (the platform under the
  team's key prefix, lf as one of the run's documents) and puts the file it
  made at `data.<field>`. A plugin declaring a `value` output of type `file`
  answers it as `files.value`: the call's value is that file.
- **`warnings`**: text the run's author should know; each is a warning on the
  run (`MOVENG_PLUGIN_WARNING`) naming nothing but what the plugin said. A
  plugin that did what it could, and tells you what it could not
  (`@lf/pdf`: characters its default font cannot draw).
- A plugin module answers `manifest` with `supportedTriggers: []` and lists
  only `manifest` and `invokePlugin` (and `refreshCredential` if it needs
  one) in `methods`.

### Kinds, settings, spend and the host's models

- **Kind.** The manifest may say what the module is: `"kind": "adapter"`,
  `"plugin"` or `"core"`. A `core` module fills one of the host's core
  services and names it in `"slot"`: `models`, `judge`, `store`, `files`,
  `limiter`, `loopGuard` or `browser`.
  The host names one module per slot (lf.yaml's `core:`); a slot's contract
  is its methods and its conformance suite: [store](store-slot.md),
  [limiter](limiter-slot.md), [loopGuard](loop-guard-slot.md),
  [models](models-slot.md), [judge](judge-slot.md), [files](files-slot.md),
  [browser](browser-slot.md), each over [the transport](#transport). A core
  module answers `manifest` with `{ protocolVersion: 2, name, kind: "core",
  slot, methods }`.
  Without `kind`, a module is an adapter, or a plugin package when it
  declares `plugins`.
- **Settings.** Construction arguments the install supplies (an Airtable
  `base`, a Sheets `spreadsheet`) are declared, each
  `{ name, label?, secret?, optional? }`:

  ```json
  "settings": [{ "name": "base", "label": "The Airtable base id" }]
  ```

  The host asks for them when the module is set up (`lf connect`, the
  platform's install screen) and sends them on every request as
  `"settings": { "base": "app123" }`.
- **One credential.** A request carries `credential`, the one the connection
  names, under the declared alternative it fills. Read it from
  `ctx.credential`; `ctx.credential.name` says which alternative it is. One
  `credentialUpdate` rides an answer: that credential's.
- **A refused token.** Answer `ok: false` with the code `credential_refused`
  when the provider refused the request's credential. The host refreshes it
  (its OAuth 2 grant, or your `refreshCredential`) and retries the call once.
- **Spend.** An answer (on success or failure) may carry what the call spent
  on a paid service:

  ```json
  { "ok": true, "result": { … }, "cost": [{ "microdollars": 1500, "label": "enrichment-api" }] }
  ```

  The host adds each line to the spend of the run that made the call, so the
  run's cost cap (`maxRunCostUsd`) counts it.
- **The host's models.** A module that declares `"hostModels": true` may ask
  the host's models slot for a model call:

  ```
  POST {listen-fire}/api/public/adapter/{adapterType}/models
  { "label": "affinity.formatLocation", "system": "…", "userMessage": "…", "model": "claude-sonnet-5" }
  → { "text": "…", "cost": [{ "microdollars": 812, "label": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5" }] }
  ```

  Authentication is the push doors'. A `schema` (a JSON schema, with
  `toolName` and `toolDescription`) asks for the reply as `data`. The door
  bills no run itself: add its `cost` to the `cost` of the answer whose work
  asked it. The module kit does both for you.
- **The host's OCR.** Any module the host started may ask its ocr slot for
  the text of a scanned PDF or an image ([ocr-slot.md](ocr-slot.md)):

  ```
  POST {listen-fire}/api/public/adapter/{adapterType}/ocr
  { "bytes": "<base64>", "contentType": "application/pdf", "label": "web.vc-url-retrieval" }
  → { "text": "…", "pages": 12, "cost": [{ "microdollars": 18000, "label": "document-ai/ocr" }] }
  ```

  Authentication is the models door's. An empty slot answers 503
  `ocr_slot_empty`, saying so. Like the models door it bills no run itself;
  the module kit's `ctx.ocr` charges the read to the answer that asked.
- **Limits.** The manifest may declare the provider's limits on calls, so the
  host never sends more than it allows:

  ```json
  "limits": [{ "scope": "credential", "calls": 100, "per": "10s" }, { "scope": "module", "concurrent": 4 }]
  ```

  Each limit counts per `scope`: `credential` (one user's grant), `module`
  (every install on the host), `install` or `team`. `calls` and `per` (a
  duration: `500ms`, `10s`, `1m`, `1h`, `1d`) go together; `concurrent` caps
  calls at once. The host holds a call until it is within all of them (its
  [limiter slot](limiter-slot.md)).
- **The limits door.** One call to a module can become several requests to
  its provider, plus retries. A module that declares `"hostLimits": true`
  (its author's choice, never implied by `limits`; see the last bullet)
  asks the host before each of those requests, so its `limits` count them
  rather than the host's calls. On each call the host hands it the door:

  ```json
  { "method": "listEntryPoints", …, "hostLimits": { "url": "http://127.0.0.1:4100/api/public/adapter/%40acme%2Fcrm/limits", "ticket": "…" } }
  ```

  Before each provider request, and after it:

  ```
  POST {hostLimits.url}            Authorization: Bearer {hostLimits.ticket}
  { "op": "acquire" }                          → { "outcome": "granted", "permit": "p7" }
                                               or { "outcome": "wait", "retryAfterMs": 400 }
  { "op": "release", "permit": "p7" }          → {}
  { "op": "throttle", "retryAfterMs": 30000 }  → {}
  ```

  - The door never waits. On `wait`, wait that long and ask again.
  - `throttle` reports a provider's "too many requests" (HTTP 429) and its
    `Retry-After`. Every request counted as the same credential (or install)
    is held until then, the host's own calls included.
  - The ticket names the call to the host. The host counts under the
    module, install, credential and team it resolved for that call; the
    module sees no counter and no scope's value.
  - The ticket is good until the call answers. A permit not yet released
    then is released by the host.
  - A call that carries `hostLimits` is not counted by the host itself, so
    no request counts twice. A call without it was counted by the host as a
    whole (lf offers the door only to a module on its own box, from a
    process that listens). The module then asks nobody.
  - The module kit does all of this inside `ctx.fetch`. A module declares
    `hostLimits` (TypeScript: `hostLimits: true` in `defineModule`; Rust:
    `.declare("hostLimits", Js::Bool(true))`) only if every provider
    request goes through `ctx.fetch` (TypeScript) or `ctx.permit()` (Rust).
    A request made any other way (the global `fetch`, another client) is
    counted by nobody, since the host stops counting that module's calls.
    The kit never declares it for you: `limits` alone leaves the host
    counting each call once. Requests to the host's own address (its files,
    its doors) are not counted. The Rust kit has no HTTP client of its own:
    take `ctx.permit()` before each request, and hand it back with
    `release()` or `throttled(retry_after)`.
  - A host that loads modules in process (the platform) or an embedder that
    hands no door is unchanged: `ctx.fetch` is then the plain fetch, and the
    host counts calls as before.
- **Throttle.** An answer (on success or failure) may carry `retryAfter`, in
  seconds: the provider asked for quiet. The host sends no further call as
  that credential (or install, without one) until then.

  ```json
  { "ok": false, "error": { "code": "rate_limited", "message": "429", "retryable": true }, "retryAfter": 30 }
  ```
- **Event idempotency.** An event (`emit`, `poll`, `preprocessInbound`) may
  carry `idempotencyKey`, the provider's own id for the occurrence; a host
  that sees one key twice runs it once. A file ref's `size` (bytes) is kept
  wherever the ref travels.

### Serving a module

A module written with the module kit (`packages/module-kit`,
`defineModule`) is served as a process by `serve-module <module>`: it binds
the socket `MODULE_SOCKET` names (else loopback on `PORT`, 0 picks one),
prints `listening unix:<path>` (or `listening <port>`), and requires
`Authorization: Bearer <MODULE_TOKEN>` when that is set. The platform loads
the same module in process; both declare the same manifest.

A module's own state (`ctx.kv`) is small JSON per install: `get`, `set`,
`delete`, `list(prefix)`, and `compareAndSet(key, expected, value)`, which
writes only when the key still holds `expected` (undefined: unset), compared
as JSON values, and answers whether it wrote — of two writers that read the
same value, one wins.

## Paging

`getRelated` returns everything at once. For a large collection implement
`iterateRelatedPage` and list it in `methods`:

```json
{ "position": { … }, "fieldId": "Company", "direction": "outgoing", "cursor": 2 }
```
→
```json
{ "items": [ { "position": { … } }, { "position": { … } } ], "nextCursor": 4 }
```

- The first call has no `cursor`. Return `nextCursor` while more remain and
  omit it on the last page.
- The cursor is any JSON value you like. Listen-Fire echoes it back unchanged.
- Returning the same cursor you were given fails the walk (it would never
  end), and so does a walk past 10,000 pages.
- Refuse a cursor you did not mint with `bad_request` (not retryable). On
  the TypeScript reference kit, throw `AdapterBadRequestError`; any other
  throw becomes `adapter_error`, which is marked retryable: a caller that
  honours the flag would ask again with the same cursor.

The TypeScript reference kit (`createAdapterProtocolHandler`) serves
`iterateRelatedPage` for you. If your in-process adapter only offers a stream
(`iterateRelated`), the kit drains it into one page capped at 1,000 items,
with no `nextCursor`, and logs a warning naming the adapter. If it offers
neither, the method answers `method_not_implemented`.

## Files

File bytes never ride the JSON envelope; they move by URL. A file is what
the envelope declares one, never a shape the data carries: a field your
catalog declares `"kind": "file"` (in `describe`), or a resource's `fileRef`.
A file ref anywhere else is data to Listen-Fire, whatever keys it carries.

- **Into your system.** A write may carry a file (in a field you declare a
  file, or a resource's `fileRef`) with a `url`:

  ```json
  { "__brand": "FileRef", "name": "deck.pdf", "contentType": "application/pdf",
    "source": { "ownerAdapterType": "email", "handle": "…" },
    "url": "https://listen-fire.example/api/files/blob/abc123" }
  ```

  `GET` the `url` at write time; it is short-lived. `__brand` is the ref's
  spelling; the field it sits in is what makes it a file. The `source` names
  the owner type and its handle only: no ref Listen-Fire sends names its
  credential or construction args. The reference kit makes the value at each
  field you declare a file a file before your code sees it.

- **Out of your system.** Return a file ref only at a field your catalog
  declares a file. Its `source` is
  `{ "ownerAdapterType": "<your adapterType>", "handle": "<your id>" }` (or a
  `url` alone), and you implement `resolveFileRef`:

  ```json
  { "ref": { "__brand": "FileRef", "name": "deck.pdf", "source": { "ownerAdapterType": "acme_crm", "handle": "f_42" } } }
  ```
  →
  ```json
  { "url": "https://crm.acme.example/files/f_42?sig=…", "contentType": "application/pdf" }
  ```

  Listen-Fire fetches the URL server-side, so it can be signed and
  short-lived. The reference kit answers `resolveFileRef` only for a ref that
  already carries a `url`; any other ref answers `method_not_implemented`.
  A ref returned at a field you do not declare a file reaches Listen-Fire as
  data: it is never read as a file (the conformance CLI's `files-declared`
  check names such a field).

## Limits and timeouts

- **Push doors** (`emit`, `wake`): a JSON body of at most 1 MB, carrying 1 to
  1,000 events or keys. A larger body is answered 413 before anything is
  read.
- **Host webhook door**: the raw body is read only for
  `content-type: application/json`, up to 100 KB. A larger body is answered
  413. A body of any other content type is not read, so its signature cannot
  verify (401).
- **Calls to your server**: Listen-Fire sets no timeout of its own; Node's
  `fetch` defaults apply (about 5 minutes for the response headers, and 5
  minutes between body chunks). A call is never retried in place, and the
  `retryable` flag is not yet acted on: a failed call fails the automation
  run that made it (an install's `manifest` call fails the install).

## Errors

Inside the envelope (HTTP 200, `ok: false`):

| `code` | `retryable` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `method_not_implemented` | false | Unknown method, or one you do not implement |
| `adapter_error` | true | Your code failed (the flag is not yet acted on: [Limits](#limits-and-timeouts)) |
| `bad_request` | false | `params` did not match the method's schema (the message is `<method>: <path>: <problem>`), or you refused the request (a cursor you never minted) |
| `protocol_version` | false | The request's `protocolVersion` is not `"2"` |

Outside it:

- HTTP 401 `unauthorized`: authentication failed.
- HTTP 400 `bad_request`: the body is not JSON, or not a request envelope.

Use your own `code` for anything else; set `retryable` honestly.

## Build your first adapter

The Acme CRM is a complete protocol-2 adapter in one dependency-free file:
[`examples/lf-acme/externals/acme_crm/server.mjs`](../../examples/lf-acme/externals/acme_crm/server.mjs).
It has one type, `Company`, with a comment thread. It uses both push doors
and the host door's methods, and it pages. Read it next to this walkthrough,
and drive it with `lf`, the same binary a user runs your adapter under.

`lf` has no adapter conformance command. These three commands make up the
check, and each runs against the example project:

- `lf check` and `lf catalog` start your server and read its `describe`: a
  catalog `lf` cannot read fails here, and a movement written against a type
  or field you did not publish is a diagnostic.
- `lf run --webhook` hands a delivery to the doors as a provider would,
  signature and all, and shows the event it became.
- `lf serve` is the real host: your server pushes to its doors, and a
  parked run resumes.

The doors themselves are held to the cases every host's doors pass by
`lf --contract-doors`, which is not a command to type: it serves the doors
for the contract suite over a JSON-RPC bridge on stdin and stdout. Run it as
`node --conditions=movement-engine-internals --test --require tsx/cjs src/__test__/inbound_contract.test.ts`
from `apps/cli`.

1. **Install the example and keep `lf check` green as you build.** Copy
   `examples/lf-acme` to a folder of your own, give it its secrets, and check:

   ```bash
   cp -R examples/lf-acme my-adapter && cd my-adapter
   mkdir .lf && cp secrets.example.yaml .lf/secrets.yaml && chmod 600 .lf/secrets.yaml
   lf check                 # 1 file(s), 0 error(s)
   lf catalog               # the catalog, with acme_crm's types, fields and the awaitable Comments edge
   ```

   To build your own, replace `externals/acme_crm/` with a folder of the same
   shape (`lf-external.yaml` names the command that serves it, or a `url:` already
   serving) and put your credential in `.lf/secrets.yaml`. `lf` refuses a
   secrets file other users can read. `lf catalog` shows what `describe`
   published: a field you meant to be writable, a file field, a missing
   `awaitable` edge, are all visible there before any movement uses them.

   Then deliver a webhook. The example verifies HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body in
   `x-listen-fire-signature`, keyed by the credential's `webhook_secret`:

   ```bash
   SIG=$(openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac dev-acme-webhook-secret -hex < events/webhook_body.json | awk '{print $NF}')
   lf run --webhook acme_crm --body events/webhook_body.json --install acme \
     --header "x-listen-fire-signature:$SIG"
   ```

   Without the header, or with a wrong one, it refuses
   (`signature did not verify for external "acme_crm"`) and runs nothing.
   `lf run --event events/company_created.json` routes one event, as your
   server's `preprocessInbound` would have shaped it, to the listens it
   matches. `lf runs` and `lf runs show <run-id>` show what each run saw.
   The fake CRM passes all of this. What a real host does with a push is
   step 7.

2. **Describe your data.** `listEntryPoints` publishes `Company` (writable,
   fires) and `Comment`. `describe` gives `Company` its fields and its
   `Comments` edge, declared `awaitable`, `watchable` and `resolvesEmpty`.

3. **Implement the required methods.** `resolveEntity` always answers no
   match, so every write creates. `createRecord` stores the company and
   returns its id and fields. `getFieldValue` reads the position's `data`.

4. **Serve it.** In TypeScript, wrap your adapter with the reference kit:

   ```ts
   const handler = createAdapterProtocolHandler({
     adapter,
     authenticate: (headers) => headers['authorization'] === `Bearer ${secret}`,
   });
   http.createServer((req, res) => void handler(req, res)).listen(port);
   ```

   The kit answers `manifest`, checks the version, validates `params`, maps
   throws to `adapter_error`, and serves paging. In another language, follow
   [the envelope](#the-envelope).

5. **Make the thread awaitable.** `resolveAwait` answers `empty` for a
   deleted company, `pending` with `thread:<company id>` for a thread with no
   comments, and `landed` with the comments otherwise.

6. **Push.** When somebody comments, the CRM `POST`s `{ "keys": ["thread:<company id>"] }`
   to `/wake`. When somebody creates a company, it `POST`s the event to
   `/emit`. Both send `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`.

7. **Try it under `lf serve`.** Start clean (`rm -rf .lf/state.db .lf/externals`,
   so the ids below are the CRM's first) and replace the example's
   `movements/companies.mvt` with `movements/discuss.mvt`:

   ```
   import { acme_crm } from adapters
   import { acme } from credentials

   crm = connect acme_crm using acme

   function discuss(company: <crm-[:Company]->>) {
     thread = write crm-[:Company]-> { Name: "Discuss ${company.Name}" }
     c = await first(thread-[:Comments]->)
     write crm-[:Company]-> { Name: "Answered ${c.Text}" }
   }

   listen to crm {} fire discuss
   ```

   Serve the project and read the port `lf` started the CRM on; the example
   keeps its companies in `.lf/externals/acme_crm/state.json`, and the CRM
   pushes to the host's doors with the credential `lf` hands it:

   ```bash
   lf serve --port 5871 &      # wait for its address line, and for .lf/externals/acme_crm/port to appear
   CRM=http://127.0.0.1:$(cat .lf/externals/acme_crm/port)
   curl -s -XPOST $CRM/dev/companies -d '{"Name":"Larch Bio"}'
   # the CRM pushes emit: {"id":"company-1","pushed":{"status":202,"body":{"accepted":1}}}
   # lf serve prints: run … discuss:discuss parked   (it wrote "Discuss Larch Bio", then awaits its first comment)
   curl -s -XPOST $CRM/dev/comments -d '{"company":"company-2","text":"approved"}'
   # the CRM pushes wake for thread:company-2; lf serve prints: resumed … discuss:discuss completed
   curl -s $CRM/dev/state      # every company the CRM holds, ending in "Answered approved"
   ```

   The doors refuse what they should. A wake presenting a credential no install
   holds answers `401`, and one naming no keys answers `400`:

   ```bash
   curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -XPOST -H 'authorization: Bearer nope' \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"keys":["thread:company-1"]}' \
     http://127.0.0.1:5871/api/public/adapter/acme_crm/wake       # 401
   ```

   Stop `lf serve` when done. `lf runs show <run-id>` shows the park and the
   wake that ended it.

## Changes

- **Delivery ids** (within version 2, no bump; 2026-10-22; additive). `inbound.deliveryId: { header }` in a declared scheme, `deliveryId` in `checkInbound`'s `accepted` answer and in `emit`'s body name the provider's id for a delivery, and the host keeps a repeat of it out. An older server declares and sends none and is unchanged; an older host ignores the field. See [Declared inbound signatures](#declared-inbound-signatures) and [emit](#emit-new-data).
- **The ocr slot and the host's OCR door** (within version 2, no bump; 2026-10-20; additive). A ninth core slot, `ocr` ([ocr-slot.md](ocr-slot.md)), and `POST …/{adapterType}/ocr` for a module's `ctx.ocr`.
- **One transport for every module kind** (within version 2, no bump; 2026-10-19). Every core slot's methods ride this envelope ([Transport](#transport)): a Unix socket on the host's box, loopback TCP without one, HTTPS for a remote module; the store, limiter and loop guard slots' stdin/stdout JSON-RPC wire is retired. New slot methods for models, judge, files and browser; a core module's manifest; per-install outgoing auth; `ctx.kv.compareAndSet`. Additive for adapters and plugins: an older server is unchanged.
- **Conformance CLI.** lf-platform's `pnpm adapter:conformance` checks a server against this protocol; run it first when building an adapter ([Build your first adapter](#build-your-first-adapter)).
- **Version 2** (current; the only version this release speaks). Breaking for a server built against version 1:
  - Requests carry `protocolVersion: "2"`, and the `manifest` answers `protocolVersion: 2`. Installing probes the server and refuses anything older.
  - Names on the wire are the natural display names; `typeId` and `fieldId` are the server's own ids.
  - Params are validated, and a mismatch answers `bad_request` naming the path.
  - New: awaits (`resolveAwait`, `wakeKeys`), the two push doors (`emit`, `wake`), paging (`iterateRelatedPage`), and files by URL.
  - A webhook subscription must return a secret, and deliveries are signed.
  - Clarified within version 2 (no bump; the reference adapter declares no file field, and conformance is unchanged for it): a file is read only at a field the catalog declares `kind: "file"` or in a resource's `fileRef`; a file ref anywhere else is data. File refs Listen-Fire sends (in a write, a position's resources, evidence) name no credential. The CLI gains `files-declared`.
- **`inbound.secretIssuedBy`** (within version 2, no bump; additive, absent means `installer`). A module says whether the installer sets its webhook signing secret or the provider issues it at registration; for `provider`, `lf connect` asks for none ([Declared inbound signatures](#declared-inbound-signatures)).
- **`deletable` on a type** (within version 2, no bump; since 0.12). A type's `describe` may say `"deletable": true` when `deleteRecord` removes one. The field is additive: an older server that never sends it still installs, speaks version 2 and passes conformance, and an automation pinned to an earlier language deletes as before. The ruling: no protocol version bump. An adapter that omits it has every `delete` of its types refused when the automation is checked (`MOV_DELETE_NOT_DECLARED`); declare it to allow them.
- **Modules** (within version 2, no bump). The manifest may declare
  `credentials`, `inbound`, `poll` and `periodic`; a request may carry
  `credential`, and a response `credentialUpdate`; three optional methods,
  `poll`, `refreshCredential` and `runPeriodic`. All additive: an older server
  declares none of them and is unchanged, and an older host ignores them. The
  ruling: no protocol version bump. See
  [Modules](#modules-credentials-signatures-and-schedules).
- **Descriptions an editor shows** (within version 2, no bump; 2026-10-20).
  A manifest's `description`, a type's, a field's and a reference's, and a
  plugin spec's, all optional. Additive: an older server sends none and is
  unchanged, and nothing is checked against them. See
  [describe](#describe) and [Plugins](#plugins).
- **Plugin modules** (within version 2, no bump). The manifest may declare
  `plugins` (a package of them), paired with the optional method
  `invokePlugin`. Additive: a server that declares none is unchanged, and an
  older host ignores the declaration. See [Plugins](#plugins).
- **The limits door** (within version 2, no bump; 2026-10-20). The
  manifest may declare `hostLimits`; a request may carry `hostLimits` (the
  door's `url` and the call's `ticket`). Additive: a module that declares
  none is counted per call as before, a host that hands no door counts the
  call itself, and an older module ignores the field. See
  [the limits door](#kinds-settings-spend-and-the-hosts-models).
- **One credential per request** (within version 2, no bump; 2026-10-17). The request's `credentials` list is removed; `credential` is the one the connection names. A module declaring several credentials declares alternatives.
- **Core modules, settings, spend** (within version 2, no bump; 2026-10-17).
  The manifest may declare `kind`, `slot`, `settings` and `hostModels`; a
  request may carry `settings`; an answer may carry `cost`;
  the error code `credential_refused`; the host's models door; an event's
  `idempotencyKey`. All additive: an older server sends and declares none of
  them and is unchanged, and an older host ignores them. See
  [Kinds, settings, spend and the host's models](#kinds-settings-spend-and-the-hosts-models).
  A store module may be a process speaking [the store slot's wire](store-slot.md).
- **Limits and throttles** (within version 2, no bump; 2026-10-18). The
  manifest may declare `limits`; an answer may carry `retryAfter`; the
  `limiter` core slot and [its wire](limiter-slot.md); the store wire's
  `work.claimDue` takes `kinds`. All additive: an older server declares and
  sends none of them and is unchanged, and an older host ignores them.
- **A module checks its own inbound** (within version 2, no bump; 2026-10-19).
  `inbound.scheme` may be `module`, paired with the optional method
  `checkInbound`: the host hands the raw request and sends the module's
  answer (events, a refusal, or a reply such as a handshake); the door also
  takes `GET` for such a module. Additive: an older server declares no such
  scheme and is unchanged, and an older host refuses the unknown scheme
  rather than leave it unverified. See [A module that checks its own
  inbound](#a-module-that-checks-its-own-inbound).
- **Version 1**: the first protocol. Not supported: an install that answers it is refused, naming the version.
