# Getting started with `lf`

`lf` runs movements from a project folder on your machine. Install it with `cargo install listen-fire`, build it with `cargo build --release -p listen-fire` (the binary is `target/release/lf`), or install a release.

## 1. Make a project

```
lf init my-project && cd my-project
```

This writes `lf.yaml`, a starter movement in `movements/`, `externals/` and `.lf/` (run state and secrets, git-ignored). It never overwrites a file that exists. `lf.yaml` pins the engine version the project runs on, and its `core:` section chooses the modules run state, models, the judge and files come from ([core slots](core-slots.md)). The defaults need no setup.

A working project to read or copy is [`examples/lf-acme`](../examples/lf-acme): one movement, one external, a sample secrets file (copy it to `.lf/secrets.yaml`).

The starter runs straight away: `lf check`, then `lf run hello`.

## 2. Write a movement

`manual` and `cron` are the host's own sources, so a movement listens to them with no import:

```
function hello(run: <manual-[:Invocation]->>) {
  return "Hello, ${run.`Run by (name)`}!"
}
listen to manual fire hello                                    # lf run hello

function digest(t: <cron-[:Tick]->>) {
  return t.`Fired at`
}
listen to cron { schedule: "0 9 * * 1" } fire digest           # lf serve or lf drain fires it
```

A system's events need its external. Put a `.mvt` file in `movements/`:

```
import { acme_crm } from adapters
import { acme } from credentials

crm = connect acme_crm using acme

function welcome(company: <crm-[:Company]->>) {
  write crm-[:Company]-> { Name: "Welcome ${company.Name}" }
}

listen to crm { events: ["company.created"] } fire welcome
```

A module with no webhooks (Granola, Evertrace, Dealroom) is polled instead: its manifest declares `poll: { intervalSeconds }`, and a listen on it reads like any other (`listen to granola fire summarise`).

- A listen can set its own interval, `listen to granola { every: 5m } fire summarise`; without it the module's interval applies.
- `lf serve` polls each such listen on the module's interval, and runs the listen on each new event.
- `lf drain` polls every listen that is due. A poll missed while nothing ran is one poll on the next drain.
- Each listen keeps its own checkpoint, so a poll asks only for what is new since the last one.
- An event a listen has run before (the same `idempotencyKey`) runs nothing.

`lf check` prints every diagnostic; fix them before running.

## 3. Connect a module

A system is reached through an external: a folder in `externals/` holding an `lf-external.yaml` that says how the host starts or reaches it.

```
lf connect              # lists the modules lf knows, and which are set up
lf connect <module>     # installs it and asks for its server secret, webhook secret and OAuth app
```

`ai(…)` and `extract(…)` call models: `lf connect @lf/anthropic` stores your API key.

`lf connect <module> --base-url <url>` points the module at a fake or a proxy instead of its provider; `--oauth-authorize-url` and `--oauth-token-url` do the same for its sign-in. [`examples/lf-attio`](../examples/lf-attio) walks Attio through end to end, against real Attio or the repo's fake.

A plugin package is an external of `kind: plugin`. `@lf/pdf` draws text as a PDF file and needs no credential:

```
# externals/pdf/lf-external.yaml
name: pdf
kind: plugin
module: "@lf/pdf"
```

```
import { `@lf/pdf` as pdf } from plugins

function report(c: <crm-[:Company]->>) {
  write crm-[:Company]-> { Name: c.Name, Report: pdf.render("Report for ${c.Name}") }
}
```

`pdf.render(text, { pageSize: "a4" | "letter", margin })` is a file (A4, 30 points of margin by default). Its writer is thin: Helvetica, no font to ship. A character outside Latin-1 (CJK, emoji) prints as `?` and the run is warned, naming `@lf/pdf`; a PDF module that embeds a font can serve the same plugin in its place.

### How lf runs a module

A movement imports only modules installed in `externals/`; installing is always `lf connect` (or a folder you add), never an import.

**A local module runs with your permissions.** lf has no sandbox yet: a module's process can read and write what you can. Install only modules you trust.

- It starts a module's process only when a run or a check needs it. A check needs one when the movement imports a live graph such as Attio's.
- It keeps the process up while it is used, and stops it after `moduleIdleTimeout` seconds unused (in `lf.yaml`; default 300). The next call starts it again.
- First-party `@lf/*` modules, and any whose `lf-external.yaml` says `trusted: true`, share one Node process. Every other module gets a process of its own.
- A module that crashes starts again on its next call. A run whose call it broke fails or retries as any failed call does.
- One call may take `callTimeout` seconds (default 600).
- A module process exits when lf does. A process left behind by a killed lf is stopped the next time lf opens the same store.
- A module's `env:` values may use `{lf}`, which lf replaces with the module's own folder, `.lf/externals/<name>/` (a place for its state and logs; not the project's `.lf`, which holds lf's state and secrets).
- `runtime: node 22` in `lf-external.yaml` says what the module runs on; a served module (`module:`) runs on node 22 unless it says otherwise. `lf check` refuses, by name, a runtime this machine lacks or has too old.

## 4. Add a credential

```
lf credential add --module <module> my_credential
```

This signs you in at the provider (OAuth) or asks for the module's fields, and stores the result in `.lf/secrets.yaml`. A movement names it with `import { my_credential } from credentials`. `lf credential list|update|delete` manage the rest. In containers and CI, set `LF_SECRET__<NAME>__<FIELD>` instead of keeping a file. Like ssh with a private key, lf refuses a secrets file that other users can read; fix it with `chmod 600 <path>` (lf itself always writes it that way).

## 5. Run

```
lf run hello                                   # run a movement a `listen to manual` fires
lf run hello --text "Acme Robotics"            # …with its Invocation's Text (`run.Text`)
lf run --event events/company_created.json     # route one event to the listens it matches
lf run --event events/company_created.json --dry-run
lf run --poll summarise                        # poll now the polled source of each listen that fires it
lf runs                                        # the runs, most recent first
lf resume [<run-id>]                           # step a parked run, or every due one
```

What a movement returns is its run's output, as a cron job's output is. Every run records it in its history, however the run started, and `lf runs show <run-id>` shows it. `lf run`, `lf resume` and `lf call` also print it when they complete the run:

```
$ lf run hello
run 32bc… hello:hello completed — 0 write(s), 0 trace entries
  returned "Hello, Ada!"
```

A run started by an event (a webhook, `cron`, a poll) sends the value nowhere: it only sits in the run's history. It never reaches an external system, and no door answers with it. The history keeps up to 64 KiB of the value's JSON, and says when it cut one short. A returned file is kept as a reference to the file, never its bytes.

## 6. Serve

```
lf serve [--port N] [--doors-only]
```

`lf serve` receives webhooks and callbacks, fires `cron` listens on their schedule, polls polled sources on their interval, and drains due work, so listens fire on their own. `lf drain` does the same work once and exits (`--until-idle`): a tick or poll missed while nothing ran happens once on the next drain, and two workers never poll one listen at once. `lf drain --kinds poll_listen` is a pool: it claims only work of those kinds (`resume_timer`, `wake_await`, `fire_event`, `fire_callback`, `poll_listen`, and `cron` for the cron ticks), so polls and run steps can be drained by separate fleets. Editing a movement under a running `lf serve` takes effect within `LF_MOVEMENTS_REFRESH_MS` (default 5000); a set that does not check is printed once and the running one kept, and a changed webhook subscription needs a restart. Set `publicUrl` in `lf.yaml` when the outside world reaches it at another address. A module that registers its own webhooks (Attio) gets one when `lf serve` starts, for the events its listens name, at `<publicUrl>/api/public/webhook-sync/<provider>/<credential>`; a restart keeps it, and it is removed once no listen needs it. `lf call <callback-id>` and `lf cancel <run-id>` act on a parked or running run. A callback's `url` is its door under `lf serve`, `/api/cb/<id>`: a POST of its values (JSON, or a form) calls it, and a browser that opens the link gets a page with a Confirm button (and a field per parameter) that posts the call, so following the link alone never calls it.

`lf serve --doors-only` (or `LF_DOORS_ONLY=1`) is for compute billed by the request, which is frozen once a response is sent. It runs no drain, `/hooks/…` queues its events (answering 202 with the rows queued), and the callback door `/api/cb/…` records the call and queues its body (answering 202) instead of running it inside the request. `lf drain` workers run the work, started on a schedule or by the [wake slot](core-slots.md#the-wake)'s module.

### Deliveries

Every delivery a door takes is kept as a receipt: the events it produced, not its bytes (no body, headers or signature are stored). `lf deliveries` lists them, most recent first (`--subscription <id>`, `--since <instant | 6h | 2d>`, `--json`), `lf deliveries show <id>` prints one with its events and the runs they started, and `lf runs show` names the delivery a run came from.

- **Redelivery.** A provider that sends its own delivery id lets the door keep a repeat out: it answers 200 with `duplicate: true` and runs nothing. A signed external declares the header in its `lf-external.yaml` (`webhook: { deliveryIdHeader: x-github-delivery }`) or its manifest (`inbound.deliveryId: { header }`); a module that checks its own inbound returns `deliveryId` from `checkInbound`; an external's `emit` may send `deliveryId` in its body. Without an id every delivery is its own, as before; an event's `idempotencyKey` still dedupes at drain.
- **Inline deliveries.** `/hooks/…` under a normal `lf serve`, and `lf run --webhook`, run their events in the request. The receipt is written first and says `inline`, so a crash before the runs leaves a receipt with no runs, which can be replayed.
- **Replay.** `lf deliveries replay <id>` keeps a new delivery holding the same events (`source: cli`, naming the one it replays) and queues them. `lf serve` or `lf drain` routes them against the project as it is now: a listen added since runs on them, and if no listen takes an event the drain says so and the replayed delivery lists no runs. A replay with no worker running waits for one.
- **Retention.** The drain forgets a delivery older than `deliveries: { retainDays: 14 }` in `lf.yaml` (a whole number of days, at least 1), unless one of its runs is still running or parked or one of its events is still queued. The runs it started stay.
- **`--ephemeral`** keeps its receipts in the session's temporary state, so they go with the session; `lf deliveries` in the same project will not list them.

## 7. Upgrade a project

> `engine:` in `lf.yaml` is the language version the project is pinned to: a release's version, such as `0.12.0`. This lf reads every pin of its own compatibility key (under 0.x, the minor: `0.12`). A newer pin is refused with "upgrade lf"; an older key is refused with "run `lf upgrade`".

`lf upgrade --check` prints what would change; `lf upgrade` rewrites the movement files into the current language version and sets `engine:` in `lf.yaml` to it.
