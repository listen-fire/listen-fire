// The app-shipped handler registry for adapter "connect actions".
//
// An adapter declares interactive connect actions in its manifest
// (`connectActions: [{ kind, label }]`); that DECLARATION travels through the
// catalog to wherever an author composes a movement — the editor's suggestion
// list and the chat affordance alike. The HANDLER that actually runs the
// action is app-shipped and lives here, keyed by `kind`. The framework never
// hardcodes a specific adapter or UI: it routes a `kind` to this map.
//
// This is the minimal-coupling line the plan draws: the declaration is general
// (any adapter, local or remote, may declare a connect action), but a remote
// adapter may only reference a `kind` the app already ships a handler for.
