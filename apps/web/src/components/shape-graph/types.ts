// Shape-graph primitive — public API.
//
// A `Shape` is a small graph: properties (typed slots) and edges (named
// walks to record-shaped destinations). The primitive renders the
// shape as a force-laid-out graph canvas with a sidebar inspector
// driven by the current selection, and a toolbar carrying add /
// rename / delete affordances.
//
// Two surfaces consume the primitive today:
//
//   • the generic-shape editor in the mapping editor (the side of a
//     mapping that uses `kind: 'generic'` — its in-memory contract is
//     a `GenericShape` with `properties` + `edges`).
//   • (deferred) the knowledge-base ontology page, whose node/edge
//     types are structurally the same plus uniqueness + scoping
//     annotations.
//
// The primitive is intentionally renderless on inspector content —
// each consumer supplies its own inspector renderer, so the picker
// vocabulary stays surface-specific (the generic-shape editor shows
// an ExpressionType picker; the ontology editor would show
// uniqueness + scoping).
