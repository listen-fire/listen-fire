/**
 * App-wide 404 surface. Next.js renders this whenever a request hits a
 * route that doesn't resolve. We give it the same calm chrome as
 * /setup — centered logo, plain-English headline, single primary CTA
 * back to home — instead of the bare "404 / This page could not be
 * found." that App Router ships by default.
 *
 * Kept as a server component (no hooks, no client state) so it can
 * render even when the user has no session.
