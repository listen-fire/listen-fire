# Health

Last full local health check **passed**: **$DATE** (commit \`$COMMIT\`).

Run \`pnpm health\` (from apps/api) to re-check. This runs the full lot —
typecheck, lint, knip, and the full unit suite — and re-stamps this file on an
all-green pass. CI itself only gates prod-safety (types, smoke, schema); this is
the heavier hygiene + full-test sweep, run on demand (≈weekly).
