// Worker liveness, in one shape, for every worker of every product this
// process mounts.
//
// The signals were all already there and all differently shaped: knowledge and
// asks each published a drainer pulse on their own product route, valuations'
// reader was written and never mounted, and the six automations loops had
// nothing but the rows they claim. This aligns them — it does not add a
// subsystem. Persisted pulses stay where they are and are read through each
// unit's registry; the in-process tick comes from the loop primitive, which is
// what gives the six unpulsed workers a last-tick for the first time.
//
// Two absences are deliberately distinguishable, because reading either as
// "wedged" is how a monitoring surface teaches people to ignore it:
//   - an UNMOUNTED product contributes no rows at all (`products` says which
//     are mounted, so a missing product is a composition fact, not a fault);
//   - a MOUNTED product's worker that this process does not run reports
//     `startedHere: false` — either another instance holds the unit's lock, or
//     the worker has nothing to do here and `idleReason` says what.
