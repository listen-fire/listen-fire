/**
 * Extraction model bake-off — which model should each tier buy?
 *
 * The tier mapping (`ai_tiers.ts`) decides what `quick` / `careful` /
 * `thorough` cost the platform, and it shipped on judgement. This settles it
 * with numbers: the SAME extraction, the SAME production prompts, over fixed
 * inputs whose right answer was written down first, run on each candidate
 * model, twice.
 *
 * What it drives, and what it does not:
 *
 * - It drives `materializeExtract` directly — the real materializer, the real
 *   prompt builder, the real response schema, the real validate-then-retry
 *   loop. Nothing about the call is reimplemented here, because a
 *   reimplementation would measure the harness.
 * - It needs no stack: no server, no database, no dev-loop slot. The runtime's
 *   three dependencies (an LLM client, a plugin invoker, an expression
 *   evaluator) are all supplied here, and the two that are not the LLM are
 *   fixed by hand so the only thing varying is the model.
 * - The plugin invoker returns FIXED text (`_fixtures/extraction_bakeoff.ts`).
 *   A bake-off that reached the network would be measuring the network.
 *
 * How the model is chosen. Production's client already maps a tier key to a
 * model id (`'opus' | 'sonnet' | 'haiku'` → the three candidates), so the
 * harness wraps that client and rewrites the key rather than pinning a model
 * id of its own. That keeps every other setting — the streamed request, the
 * input-proportional output ceiling, the one-continuation cap, the tier's
 * reasoning effort — exactly production's, which is the only way the numbers
 * transfer.
 *
 * How the tokens are read. They exist for about a millisecond: the Anthropic
 * wrapper logs them, records them to `llm_usage` under the ambient team, and
 * drops them. With no team there is no row, so the harness reads the log line
 * the wrapper already writes, through a pass-through wrapper on the logger.
 * Deliberately a read-only tap — the alternative was a callback seam through
 * two shared production files, which is not worth carrying for a measurement
 * script.
 *
 * Usage (real API spend — every run costs money):
 *
 *   pnpm dev:extraction-bakeoff --dry-run              # prompts + plan, no calls
 *   pnpm dev:extraction-bakeoff --fixtures slack_small --reps 1
 *   pnpm dev:extraction-bakeoff --out /tmp/bakeoff     # round 1's full matrix
 *
 * Round 2 (`--conditions`) asks a different question — see {@link CONDITIONS}.
 * It compares whole TIER SETTINGS rather than models, on the two fixtures hard
 * enough to separate them:
 *
 *   pnpm dev:extraction-bakeoff --conditions A,B,C \
 *     --fixtures reconcile_long,nested_synthesis --reps 3 --out /tmp/round2

// ── Round 2: the conditions ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Round 1 compared three models at one fixed reasoning effort. It could not
// price the `thorough` tier, because `thorough` is not a model — it is a model
// PLUS a thinking configuration plus an output ceiling, and round 1 varied only
// the first of those. Round 2 varies all three together, as one setting each,
// and asks the only question left: what does the expensive tier buy?
//
// Two things about these settings are worth stating rather than inferring.
//
// 1. WHICH MODEL IS ASKED TO THINK. The chat wrapper sends `thinking` and
//    `output_config` only when the caller names an effort. So an arm with no
//    effort sends neither field — and what that MEANS is a property of the
//    model, not of us: on `claude-opus-4-7` an absent `thinking` runs the model
//    with NO thinking at all, while on `claude-sonnet-5` and `claude-opus-5` it
//    runs adaptive thinking at the model's own default depth. The `thorough`
//    tier as mapped today therefore buys the LEAST reasoning of the three arms
//    below, at the highest price per token.
// 2. WHERE THE OUTPUT TOKENS COME FROM. Thinking tokens are billed as output
//    and are counted in `usage.output_tokens`, which is what the tap reads. The
//    `out tok` column is therefore total BILLED output — visible answer plus
//    reasoning — which is the number the cost comparison needs.
