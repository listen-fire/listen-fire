/**
 * What a model does when NOBODY names a thinking depth.
 *
 * The tier map carries a written claim — opus-4-7 in that silence does not
 * think at all, opus-5 in the same silence thinks by default — and cites a
 * bake-off page that exists on no branch. The claim decides whether renaming a
 * model at a call site with a small output ceiling is safe, because thinking is
 * paid for out of that same ceiling. So it gets re-established rather than
 * trusted.
 *
 * The probe is deliberately the smallest thing that can answer it: one request
 * per model, straight at the platform client, with no `thinking` field on the
 * wire at all. What comes back is read at the block level — a `thinking` block
 * present or absent is the whole finding — and the token counts come along so
 * the cost of that silence is visible too.
