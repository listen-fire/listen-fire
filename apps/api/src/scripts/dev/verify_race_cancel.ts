/**
 * Provisioner for the live combinator-cancellation e2e: a `race` whose one arm
 * awaits an ask response and whose other is a SHORT sleep, so both outcomes are
 * drivable inside a dev-loop session (the handbook's 2d timeout is not).
 *
 * The point of the short timer is the LOSER'S PARK. When the timer wins, the
 * ask arm's park has to be withdrawn — and the only honest proof is that a LATE
 * answer to that ask resumes nothing. Unit tiers can assert the park row is
 * gone; only the live stack can show the answer arriving afterwards and the run
 * staying settled.
 *
 * Drive it with:
 *
 *   pnpm dev:movement run race_cancel_probe          # answered-wins leg
 *   pnpm dev:inspect slack                           # → "race: answered=<v>"
 *
 *   pnpm dev:movement run race_cancel_probe          # timer-wins leg
 *   # …wait out the sleep + the 30s timer scan…
 *   pnpm dev:inspect slack                           # → "race: answered=timeout"
 *   pnpm dev:inject ask-answer --token <the ask's>   # the LATE answer
 *   pnpm dev:inspect slack                           # → unchanged

/**
 * `sleep(30s)` rather than a minute: the timer worker scans every 30s, so the
 * timer-wins leg settles inside a minute of wall clock while still leaving a
