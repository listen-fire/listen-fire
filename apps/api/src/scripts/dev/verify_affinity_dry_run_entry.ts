/**
 * Rehearse the mission's write through the real movement engine against a live
 * fake Affinity, and show what the rehearsal reports.
 *
 * The acceptance: adding a company to a list, with the list's own fields set,
 * and an `Owners` edge off the entry — all of it captured, none of it sent, and
 * the trace showing WHICH organization the entry was added to and which
 * entry the owner landed on.
 *
 * Three things to see:
 *   1. every field of the entry write appears in the capture;
 *   2. the entry capture names the organization it hangs off, and the edge;
 *   3. the `Owners` write off the entry is its own capture, naming the entry as
 *      its parent — and marked `rehearsed`, because that entry does not exist.
 *
 * Usage: FAKE_BASE=http://localhost:6291/affinity ts-node … verify_affinity_dry_run_entry.ts
