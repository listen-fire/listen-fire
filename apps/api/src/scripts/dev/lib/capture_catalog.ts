// Demand-scoped catalog capture — the pure half.
//
// The handbook's checker fixture used to be captured by a FULL-SURFACE sweep:
// instantiate every adapter, describe everything it publishes. No real save has
// ever worked that way. A save describes what its movement's chains DEMAND
// (`demandSeed` + `closeDemandOverChains`), which is exactly why a
// container-shaped adapter refuses a full-surface describe — so the sweep
// captured NOTHING for Attio and every handbook example that names `Companies`
// checked against a position nobody had looked at.
//
// So the capture drives the same closure a save drives, over movement sources.
// Two pieces are pure and live here; the I/O (one `movementCatalogForTeam` per
// source) lives in the CLI.
//
//   - `rewriteConnectionNames` — the handbook names connections
//     ILLUSTRATIVELY (`acme`, `main_crm`, `team_chat`); a workspace's
//     connections are its own. Rewire each probe's credential to the dev-loop
//     connection for the SAME adapter, so the demand closure resolves. The
//     alias→adapter mapping is read off the probe itself
//     (`referencedConstructions`), never a hand-maintained table — a table
//     would go stale the first time a chapter invents a new alias, and go stale
//     silently (an unresolved connection leaves the instance untyped, which is
//     the checker staying silent, not erroring).
//
//   - `mergeInstanceSchemas` — a per-source capture describes only that
//     source's demand, so the fixture is the UNION over the demand set. The one
//     rule with teeth: a DESCRIBED position beats an undescribed one. Both
//     schemas come from the same adapter, so where both describe a position
//     they describe it identically; where one didn't look, `undescribed` is the
//     absence of a claim and must never overwrite a real one.
