maya: two things came out of the Berlin trip worth writing up.
maya: first is Loambank — https://loambank.eu — they do treasury sweep for small banks, so squarely fintech for us. Their CEO is Astrid Køhler and she's the one who'd run the process.
tomas: I liked Loambank. Rev is small but the pipeline was real.
maya: second is Fernwater (https://fernwater.io). Grid-scale heat storage, very much a climate bet. We met Rajesh Manoharan, who is CTO and effectively the founder.
priya: noting that Fernwater has no revenue yet, purely pre-product.
tomas: agreed on both. I'll open the files.
maya: one more mention — Karl Beck from the Aurum fund was on the same panel, but that's not a company, just a co-investor.

priya: 4. Tallow & Co (https://tallowand.co) — direct-to-consumer skincare, so a consumer deal. We spoke to Marguerite Fell, who founded it.
${filler(14, 28)}
dan: for the record, Halberd's website is halberd.systems not halberd.dev, someone had it wrong in the notes.

// Round 1's seven fixtures all scored 100% for sonnet-5, so none of them can
// show one model beating another: a ceiling measures nothing. The two H
// fixtures exist to break that ceiling, and they do it the only honest way —
// by asking questions whose right answer is not visible in any one place.
//
// Here that means a thread that CORRECTS ITSELF. Every field's answer is
// stated plainly somewhere; what is hard is that the first statement is often
// wrong by the end, and the message that overturns it is thousands of
// characters away. A model that reads locally and answers from the nearest
// supporting quote gets a well-formed, entirely wrong tree.

// Two calibration rounds are baked into the shape of this fixture, and both are
// findings in their own right.
//
// ROUND 1 of calibration put every correction in one tidy "housekeeping" block
// near the end. Sonnet-5 at effort `high` scored 100%: once you are reading a
// list of corrections, you know to apply them. So the amendments were scattered
// — each one thousands of characters from the claim it overturns and from every
// other amendment — and harder shapes were added: a second rename on top of the
// first, a "company" that turns out to be another company's product, an
// amendment that is not one, and a headcount whose restatement is itself
// corrected.
//
// ROUND 2 scored 100% too. Comprehension is not the binding constraint, so the
// last lever is VOLUME: eleven companies rather than six, every one of them
// carrying at least one amendment, none of them adjacent to its own. What that
// asks for is bookkeeping across ~30k characters, which is a different faculty
// from reading a passage correctly.

//
// The second way a fixture can be hard: no single passage holds the answer
// because the answer does not appear anywhere. Every second-stage field here
// has to be COMPUTED from a first-stage field plus the enrichment block —
// which office is the headquarters, which round comes after which, cash over
// burn, and who holds the role a reference note names. The enrichment is
// written to reward the synthesis and punish the shortcut: the biggest office
// is never the HQ, the largest round is never the one named, and the obvious
// senior person is not always the one reported to.

// Calibration note. The first cut of this fixture stated each second-stage
// answer almost directly — one office number per city, one burn rate, one
// obvious prior employer — and sonnet-5 at effort `high` scored 100%. Each
// answer now needs one more step than reading: the headquarters city appears as
// two separate lines that must be summed, the burn rate that matters is the
// forward one rather than the one quoted first, the round to name is the most
// recent PRICED one, the most recent prior employer is the shortest and
// last-mentioned stint, and the person reported to is described by what they do
// rather than by their title. One reference note names no prior employer at
// all, against the pull of five that do — the null every other answer in the
// fixture argues against.
