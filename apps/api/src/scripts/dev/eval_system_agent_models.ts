/**
 * Which model should the system conversation agent run on?
 *
 * The agent behind `/v1/system` is the one agent mounted in every deployment,
 * and it is the last place in the product still reaching an Opus 4 model. This
 * puts the candidates through the REAL agent — the real system prompt, the real
 * tool surface, the real grounding check and its one corrective turn — over a
 * fixed set of single turns against the seeded dev team, and scores them on the
 * two things that decide the question: did it call the right tools, and is the
 * answer true of the data.
 *
 * What it does and does not touch:
 *
 * - It calls `runUnifiedAgent` directly, not the conversation orchestrator. The
 *   orchestrator adds history persistence and compaction, which would make one
 *   arm's turn depend on an earlier arm's.
 * - It runs with the WRITE scopes off. Every mutating tool the agent has —
 *   entity and model editing, and saving an automation live — is out of reach,
 *   so no arm can leave the seeded team different from how it found it, and the
 *   arms all see the same data.
 * - The one thing overridden inside the agent is which model answers. That is a
 *   named option on the agent (`modelUnderTest`); no product caller sets it, and
 *   an arm that names nothing is byte for byte today's request.
 *
 * How the numbers are read. `runUnifiedAgent` returns the tool trace but no
 * token counts, so the per-turn line the Anthropic wrapper already logs is
 * tapped read-only — the same tactic the extraction bake-off uses, and for the
 * same reason: a callback seam through a shared production file is not worth
 * carrying for a measurement script. The grounding check's own warning is
 * tapped too, because a corrective turn having fired is otherwise invisible
 * from outside the agent.
 *
 * Usage (real API spend):
 *
 *   pnpm dev:eval-system-agent --dry-run
 *   pnpm dev:eval-system-agent --arms base,sonnet5 --prompts companies,catalog
 *   pnpm dev:eval-system-agent --out /tmp/agentbake
 *
 * Needs the dev stack up (`pnpm dev:loop:agent`) and seeded (`pnpm dev:seed`).
 * The expected answers below are this team's real state, so re-read them
 * against the database before trusting a rerun.
