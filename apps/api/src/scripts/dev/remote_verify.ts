/**
 * Dev-loop e2e harness for a user-supplied "remote" adapter (a homespun CRM).
 *
 *   pnpm dev:remote-verify
 *
 * Prerequisites: the dev loop must be free (this holds no server of its own —
 * it runs a movement through the SAME dispatch path the API uses) and the
 * dev-loop team must be seeded (`pnpm dev:seed`). See REMOTE_ADAPTER_VERIFY.md.
 *
 * What it proves, end to end:
 *   1. an in-process fake CRM served behind the wire protocol (port 0);
 *   2. a `remote_adapter` row installed for the dev-loop team pointing at it,
 *      with a matching credential row holding the bearer secret;
 *   3. a movement that constructs `acme_crm()` and, on a manual invocation,
 *      writes a `Company` to it;
 *   4. `runMovementNow` firing that movement — and the write actually landing
 *      in the fake CRM's in-memory ledger over real HTTP.
 *
 * This is the write-target mirror of `dev:movement`: same `ensureDevLoopTeam`
 * + `saveMovement` + `runMovementNow` spine, with the remote-adapter install +
 * credential provisioning added.
