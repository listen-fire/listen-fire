/**
 * The durable dev-loop fake-CRM fixture.
 *
 *   pnpm dev:fake-crm
 *
 * Serves the fake CRM (`fake_crm_adapter.ts`) behind the remote-adapter wire
 * protocol on this profile's `FAKE_REMOTE_ADAPTER_PORT`, and stays up for the
 * life of the dev loop — `dev/loop.sh` starts it alongside fake-channels.
 *
 * Why durable: `acme_crm` is installed as a `remote_adapter` ROW, and a row
 * outlives the process that wrote it. When the server bound an ephemeral port,
 * every consumer of that row (the graph explorer) hit a dead
 * socket the moment the installing script exited. A profile-assigned port makes
 * the installed URL a standing promise instead of a snapshot, so the one remote
 * adapter in the loop is inspectable like every other system.
 *
 * The write ledger is in-memory and per-process: restarting the loop forgets
 * the Companies written to it, which is the same deal fake-channels offers.
