/**
 * The side-by-side: both `research` engines over one fixture set, one judge,
 * one table.
 *
 * The plugin exists to settle which engine drives the loop, and that is a
 * question about a corpus rather than about an entry — an engine that wins on
 * Larkfield and loses on a bare name has told you nothing. So this runs every
 * entry through both engines, has a model grade what came back against what
 * the entry asked, prices both from what they actually spent, and writes the
 * table you read.
 *
 * The judge never touches the web. It grades what it is given, which is the
 * only way its verdict is about the engine rather than about its own research.
 *
 * The fixture file lives OUTSIDE the repo: you write it from your own runs.
 *
 * Usage (real API spend — every run costs money):
 *
 *   pnpm dev:eval-research --fixtures ~/scratch/research_fixtures.json \
 *     --out ~/scratch/eval [--engine constrained|agentic|both] \
 *     [--judge claude-opus-5] [--only larkfield] [--concurrency 2]
 *
 * A resource-constrained machine can't always hold a 13-entry, both-engine
 * run to the end — `--only <id>[,<id>…]` runs one entry, or a few, by their
 * exact fixture `id` (both engines finish one in under three minutes) and
 * writes its own `research_eval_*.json`/`.md` pair, same as a full run does.
 * A fixture `name` is not enough on its own to pick one out — several ids can
 * share a name (`larkfield`, `larkfield-site-only`) — so `--only` never matches on
 * it. Once every entry has run once, assemble the
 * combined report without spending anything again:
 *
 *   pnpm dev:eval-research --merge ~/scratch/eval --out ~/scratch/eval
 *
 * `--merge <dir>` reads every `research_eval_*.json` in that directory,
 * keeps the newest record per (entry, engine) — so a rerun of a cheap entry
 * supersedes an earlier attempt rather than double-counting it — and renders
 * one report from the union, exactly as a single `--engine both` run would
 * have.
 *
 * ── The fixture file ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A JSON array (or `{ "entries": [ … ] }`) of:
 *
 *   {
 *     "id": "larkfield",                    // unique, names the row
 *     "name": "Larkfield",                  // the subject, as a message named it
 *     "context": "Danish school…",       // optional: what the message said
 *     "context_confidence": "sure",      // optional: "sure" | "guess" — how
 *                                        //   much the context can be trusted;
 *                                        //   a WRONG context reliably makes an
 *                                        //   entry no_match, so a guess that
 *                                        //   fails is the fixture's fault
 *     "website": "https://larkfield.example",    // optional address the entry carries
 *     "linkedin": "https://…/in/…",      // optional
 *     "url": "https://…",                // optional: an article, a listing
 *     "questions": "what it does, …",    // what the dossier must answer
 *     "expect": { "outcome": "no_anchor", "website": "https://larkfield.example" }
 *   }
 *
 * `expect` is optional and either half of it is. `outcome` is compared
 * exactly; `website` is compared with scheme, `www.` and a trailing slash
 * ignored.

const JUDGE_SYSTEM = `You are grading one research write-up. You have no web access and you must not use anything you happen to know about the subject: grade only what is in front of you. A claim you cannot see is not answered, however true it is.

THE QUESTIONS. The caller asked one question per comma-separated clause, in the order written. Return one row per clause, in that order, quoting the clause as "question". A clause is:
- "answered" — the write-up states it plainly, and it is attributed to a source.
- "partly" — gestured at, hedged, or stated without support.
- "not_answered" — absent.
- "wrong" — the write-up states something that contradicts the context the caller gave, or attributes to the subject something that plainly belongs to a different organisation or person of the same name. Reserve this for a contradiction you can see in the material, not for a claim you merely doubt.
Give a one-line reason for every row.

THE DOSSIER. "dossier_relevance" 1-5: is the content SIZED TO THE QUESTIONS? 5 = every excerpt bears on a question asked. 3 = useful content padded with material nobody asked for. 1 = a homepage dump, a boilerplate about-us, or nothing at all.

THE SUMMARY'S FORM. This is the one that matters most and the easiest to miss. A summary must ANSWER the questions. A summary that instead reports on the research — that the subject was found, that the site checks out, that the identity is confirmed — has told the caller about the verification and not about the subject. An opener like "X checks out as the company described" is a verification statement, not an answer.
- "answers" — it answers, start to finish.
- "verifies" — it reports on the verification rather than answering.
- "mixed" — it opens on the verification and then answers, or answers and pads with it.
Give a one-line "summary_note" saying which and quoting the giveaway phrase when there is one.

WHAT WAS EXPECTED. When the caller states an expected outcome or an expected website, say whether what came back matches. "not_applicable" when nothing was expected. One line in "expect_note".`;
