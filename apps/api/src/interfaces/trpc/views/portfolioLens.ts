/**
 * What a portfolio line means — two answers, and which one a caller gets is
 * its own choice.
 *
 * Under `holdings`, a line is "what I hold in this company now". Shares taken
 * in a share-for-share sale are still ours, but they are no longer a holding
 * in the company we bought into — they are a holding in the company that
 * bought it. So the value moves onto the acquirer's own line and the acquired
 * company keeps only what still tracks it, which for a clean sale is nothing
 * at all.
 *
 * Under `investment`, a line is "a company I put money into". Nothing moves:
 * the swap shares stay folded into the line for the investment that earned
 * them, and an acquirer only appears if we invested into it directly.
 *
 * The projection is arithmetic over figures the valuation already returns:
 * full retained minus retained-in-company is exactly the value that moves. It
 * creates and destroys no atom, so portfolio totals are identical under both
 * lenses — only which line carries the value moves.
