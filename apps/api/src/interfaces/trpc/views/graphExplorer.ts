/**
 * tRPC surface for the hidden `/graph-explorer` page — the live adapter
 * type-graph explorer.
 *
 * `listInstances` names a team's introspectable systems (a connected adapter
 * per credential type, plus remotes). `walk` stands on ONE position of ONE of
 * them and returns exactly what the authoring agent gets from
 * `describeConnection`: the node, its properties, and its edges, each edge
 * carrying where it lands and the address that walks it.
 *
 * NOTHING here loads a graph. One call is one hop, scoped to the position
 * asked about — the caller echoes an edge's `position` to go deeper, exactly as
 * the agent does. That is not merely cheaper: the explorer's whole value is
 * showing what the agent sees, so it must see it BY THE SAME ROUTE. A second
 * walker would render its own defects as adapter facts.
 *
 * `types: []` says the quiet part: the explorer asks for no schema projection
 * at all. The walk is the entire surface.
 *
 * Cross-team introspection (any team by id) is a LOCAL/DEV affordance, gated to
 * non-production: it lets an operator inspect the seeded dev-loop team's graphs.
 * PRACTICAL CAVEAT — the dev-loop team's credentials carry a `baseUrl` pointing
 * at fake-channels (`:6056`), so introspecting them only RESOLVES on a stack
 * where fake-channels is running (the dev-loop stack). Cross-team introspection
 * is therefore inherently a local-stack feature, which is exactly why prod is
 * never allowed to introspect another team.
 *
