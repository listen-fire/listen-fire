/**
 * tRPC surface for the control tower (async user interaction chunk 7b, 3b/§5.6).
 * The operator surface that answers "what's waiting on a human, and what can I do
 * about it":
 *
 *   - listParkedRuns / listOpenAsks — pure reads over `trigger_run` +
 *     `interaction_request` (never the heavy `parked_run.state` blob).
 *   - answerAskOnBehalf / redeliverAsk / abortRun — operator actions, each
 *     delegating to the existing engine primitive (recordAnswer /
 *     redeliverAskDelivery / failRunAndCancelRequests). The operator is an authed
 *     user, so no token is involved.
 *
 * Everything is team-scoped via `userProcedure` + the service-layer ownership
 * checks (a cross-team id reads as not-found).
