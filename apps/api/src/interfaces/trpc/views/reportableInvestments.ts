// The predicate needs to reach `event` and `transaction` to recognise a

// `getValuationsQb` is already bound to the schema and calls them `event` /
// `transaction`, while a cross-schema `getQb` spells the crossing out as
// `valuations.event` / `valuations.transaction`. Both tables come from the
// same accessor call, so the caller states the event table's name and the
// transaction table's name is read off it — the way every other schema
// crossing on this branch is stated rather than assumed.

/**
 * "Is this investment row one we report figures for?"
 *
 * Recording an acquisition mints a hidden position for the equity taken as
 * consideration: one investment INTO the acquirer per selling fund, standing
 * for the stock handed over in the swap. The cash leg of a mixed deal is booked
 * on that hidden row's transaction, and the same cash also reaches the acquired
 * company's line through the roll-up — so any surface that values both rows
 * counts the realisation twice, and any surface that lists companies gives the
 * acquirer a line as if we had bought into it.
 *
 * Three mechanisms mark such a row, and a row is reportable only if it carries
 * none of them:
 *
 *  - tagged to a DISTRIBUTION event (`event_id`), which is how the acquisition
 *    command has minted its consideration position since it was built;
 *    `event_id` is NULL on every other investment-creation path.
 *  - typed EQUITY_TRANSFER, the type an API author gives a share-for-share
 *    position that carries no event of its own.
 *  - reached by a transaction that settles ANOTHER company's exit: the swap's
 *    transaction names both this position and that exit. This is the only tie
 *    the exit flow that predates the acquisition command left behind, and the
 *    positions it wrote are still in the data — an untagged position on an
 *    acquirer, which is what put acquirers we never invested into on the
 *    portfolio list. A position settled by its OWN company's distribution is
 *    the ordinary exit and stays reportable, which is what the entity
 *    comparison is for.
 *
 * This governs which rows are VALUED, not which events are listed: an
 * acquisition event belongs to the company, not to the hidden investment, so
 * event listings still show it — only its per-row valuation lines disappear.
