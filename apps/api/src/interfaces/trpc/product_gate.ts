// Which unit each tRPC view router belongs to, and the door that enforces it.

// The router TREE stays whole. `packages/trpc` generates one `.d.ts`
// from it for every frontend, and building the tree conditionally would make
// its type depend on an environment variable — so a process that does not run
// a product refuses that product's procedures instead of not declaring them.
// Phase 7's exports do the structural version of this: a product's repo simply
// does not contain the other products' router files, and `codegen:trpc` runs
// against the subset (8_teardown.md on `packages/trpc`).
//
// The map records only what the unit plans SETTLE. A router nobody has claimed
// is not guessed at here — it stays mounted everywhere, and claiming it is a
// Phase 7 obligation rather than a silent default.
