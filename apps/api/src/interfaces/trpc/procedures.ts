// The protected tRPC procedures, in one place (core plan §4).
//
// Every router used to declare its own near-identical `userProcedure`, and the
// base tRPC context is only `{ authorise }` — identity has always arrived
// through the ambient store rather than the procedure. Three consequences the
// duplication hid, all fixed by having one of these:
//
//  - `authorise()` is a no-op over HTTP (express authenticated the request long
//    before tRPC sees it) but is the ONLY thing that establishes identity over
//    the websocket. The copies that omitted it worked over HTTP and threw
//    "Missing user" over WS.
//  - the ambient Principal is what product code reads; a procedure that runs
//    outside an express request (`createCaller` in a worker, a script, the MCP
//    caller) had none, so it is installed here from whatever identity the call
//    does have.
//  - the per-call `UserService.getById` existence check is gone: both doors
//    (the express funnel and the WS `authorise`) already refuse a user without
//    granted access, so it was a second lookup that could only ever agree.
//
// Deviation from the plan's sketch, recorded: §4 puts these in
// `packages/principal/trpc`. tRPC's `.use()` returns a DIFFERENT builder type
// than it was called on, so a `<T extends AnyTRPCBuilder>(t: T) => T` signature
// cannot be written without erasing input/output inference — the shared
// procedure has to know the app's own tRPC instance. The package keeps the
// identity contract; the tRPC binding of it lives beside the router tree.
