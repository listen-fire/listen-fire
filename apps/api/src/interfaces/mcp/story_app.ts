// The automation's story, drawn INSIDE the conversation.
//
// MCP Apps (SEP-1865) let a tool nominate an HTML view the client renders in
// the chat and hands the tool's result to. `getAutomation` nominates this one:
// the same board the workbench draws and the same board a story link opens,
// so a person asking their agent "what does this actually do?" sees the
// picture without leaving the thread.
//
// TWO PIECES, and both are inert on their own:
//
//   the view — `apps/api/public/story/app.html`, one self-contained file. An
//   app is sandboxed with `default-src 'none'`, so a page that fetches its own
//   script renders nothing at all. Built by `pnpm --filter story-view bundle`
//   (the API's build runs it); absent, `resources/read` fails and the client
//   falls back to the tool's text, which is exactly what it did before.
//
//   the story — projected here and attached to the result's `_meta`, where it
//   reaches the view and no model. Projection is the story link's own path
//   (`servedStoryView`, memoised on the source), so the picture in the chat
//   and the picture behind the link are the same picture.
//
// NOTHING HERE MAY FAIL A TOOL CALL. Every failure returns the result
// untouched: a client that never heard of Apps must see `getAutomation`
// behave exactly as it always has, and a client that has must degrade to the
// link rather than to a blank panel.
