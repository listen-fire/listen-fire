 * A bundle, into this deployment.

 * and the only rows it reads are that team's — it has no expression that could
 * reach another tenant. Ids are preserved, so the movements, triggers and
 * graph edges that reference each other still do. Nothing is re-minted:
 * credentials arrive as shells and the connect surface asks for a reconnect.
