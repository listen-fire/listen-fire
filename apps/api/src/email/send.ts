// The one way this codebase should call the outbound email seam.

// `services.email.send` returns FALSE when the provider rejected the message.
// Every caller used to `await` it and drop the boolean, so a Mailgun 4xx was
// indistinguishable from a delivered email — the notice paths even logged
// "sent". This wrapper makes a rejection visible (error log, and a
// success=false row in outbound_email via the ledger decorator) and hands the
// boolean back, so callers with a user-facing channel can tell the truth.
//
// It also carries the `kind` tag into the ledger, which is what makes the ledger
// queryable by what the message WAS rather than by its subject line.
