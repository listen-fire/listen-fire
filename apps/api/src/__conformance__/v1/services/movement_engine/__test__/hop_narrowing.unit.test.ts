// A hop whose WHERE narrows a POLYMORPHIC edge to one member, at RUNTIME.
//
// The checker already rebinds such a hop to the selected member's own surface
// (`InstanceSchema.refinements`). The runtime has to agree, or a landed record
// of a DIFFERENT member gets the selected member's WHERE evaluated against it
// and drifts on a field that member never had. It is not schema drift — the
// record is simply not on the addressed path — so it is dropped, silently,
// before any of its fields are read.
//
// Two behaviours are pinned here, through the REAL interpreter:
//   1. the member gate — every walker (block head, expression hop, EXISTS hop)
//      drops a landed record whose `recordType` is not the member the host
//      selected for that hop (`InstanceSchema.selectedMembers`);
//   2. AND short-circuit on the pure predicate path — a conjunct already false
//      stops the rest of the WHERE from being read, exactly as the full async
//      evaluator does.
