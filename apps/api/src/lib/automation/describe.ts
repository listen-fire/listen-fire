/**
 * Plain-English description of an automation — drives the headline at
 * the top of `/automations/[id]` and (eventually) row-level one-liners
 * in `/automations` and on the home page.
 *
 * Deterministic, no LLM: given the trigger row, produce a single
 * sentence the user can read without knowing what a "translation
 * graph" is. The headline names only the *source* — what kicks the
 * automation off:
 *
 *   "When an email arrives tagged `dealflow`."
 *   "When a Slack message arrives in #dealflow."
 *
 * The actions/destination deliberately don't appear here: the program
 * tree below the headline ("What happens") already lays those out
 * step by step, so repeating them in the sentence is noise. The
 * headline answers "what starts this?", the tree answers "then what?".
 *
 * If no actions have been defined yet we fall back to a calm "setup in
 * progress" sentence — the trigger exists but isn't wired to anything.
 *
 * Lives under `apps/api/src/lib/automation/` (sibling of `status.ts`)
 * so U3 (home dashboard) can reuse it for the activity feed and the
 * automations-row one-liner without re-deriving from raw JSONB.
