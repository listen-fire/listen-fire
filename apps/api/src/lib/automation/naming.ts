/**
 * User-facing name for an automation trigger.
 *
 * A movement-derived trigger's `trigger.name` is compiled at provisioning
 * time as `movement/<file>/<fired-movement>` (`movement/store.ts`) — an
 * internal dispatch key, never meant for display. Every surface that shows
 * an automation's name must resolve the REAL movement instead of leaking
 * that string; `resolveAutomationName` does the one-hop join callers should
 * prefer (`trigger.movement_id` → `movement.name`), matching how
 * `views.movement.list` already treats `listener.movementName` as
 * authoritative over the raw name.
 *
 * `parseTriggerName` is the fallback for surfaces with no movement row to
 * join against (e.g. the movement's own row was deleted, or a legacy
 * trigger predates `movement_id`) — a magic string, parsed rather than
 * compared, so it stays a last resort rather than the primary path.
 *
 * Lives beside `status.ts` / `describe.ts`: pure, no DB reach-in, callers
 * hand in what they already fetched.
