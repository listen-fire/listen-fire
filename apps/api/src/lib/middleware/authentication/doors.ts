// Inbound doors: the auth branches core does NOT own.
//
// A webhook that authenticates by HMAC signature, or an inbound email whose
// sender decides the team, is a fact about the PRODUCT that receives it — core
// has no way to check either and no business knowing they exist (core plan §4;
// D28/D31 make the same call for the phone and address families). So the funnel
// takes a list of doors from whoever composed the process, tries them by URL
// before it tries any credential of its own, and the product implements them
// beside the adapter that reads the payload.
//
// A door resolves an IDENTITY, not a whole Principal: the acting-team gate,
// impersonation and the access level are core's tail, and running them for
// doors too is the point — a door cannot accidentally hand itself a team its
// user is not a member of.
