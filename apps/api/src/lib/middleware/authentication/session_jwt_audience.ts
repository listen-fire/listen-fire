/**
 * The `audience` claim on our OWN self-signed HS256 session + realtime tokens.
 * There is no Auth0 and hasn't been for a long time, so the var is
 * `SESSION_JWT_AUDIENCE` — but its VALUE is baked into every live session
 * cookie and realtime token, so changing the value (not just the name)
 * signs everyone out at once. Hence accept-both: a deployment can carry the
 * legacy `AUTH0_AUDIENCE` through the rename and swap the key at its leisure,
 * as long as the value stays identical.
 *
 * Resolved once per process, so the legacy-name warning is logged once rather
 * than on every request that mints or verifies a token.
