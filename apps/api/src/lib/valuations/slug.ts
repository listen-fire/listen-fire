// Minting a legal entity's URL slug.
//
// `legal_entity.slug` is what the app addresses a company by
// (`/portfolio/c/[slug]`), and a row without one is not merely ugly — it is
// UNREACHABLE. The deals table renders its link as
// `row.company?.slug ? … : null`, so a null slug silently produces a dead row
// rather than an error anyone would notice.
//
// The REST create takes `slug` as an optional caller-supplied field, so every
// caller that is not the UI — an automation, a script, an integration — used
// to create companies nobody could click. Minting here, on the way in, is the
// one place that fixes all of them at once.

/**
 * A slug for `name` that is actually free, or undefined when `name` slugifies
 * to nothing at all (a name of pure punctuation — rare, but a company called
 * "!!!" should not become a row with an empty-string slug).
 *
 * `legal_entity_slug_key` is unique GLOBALLY, not per team, so a slug free for
 * this team can still collide with another team's row. Hence the probe rather
 * than a bare `slugify`, and a short random suffix on collision.
 *
 * This narrows the race but does not close it: two concurrent creates can both
 * probe clear and then both insert. The unique index is the real guard — the
 * loser gets a constraint violation, which is the correct outcome for a
 * duplicate and is surfaced as such.
