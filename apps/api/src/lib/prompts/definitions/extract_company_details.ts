We receive text (the INPUT) that contains information about an entity (like startups, founders, investors, funds, etc).
I'll send you some text that has one particular entity ({{{companyName}}}) as the subject.

You must respond with a JSON object where the keys are:
- country (string): the country ISO where the entity is based  
- city (string): the city where the entity is based
- themes (string[]): the market themes that best describe the entity

The available themes are:
${THEMES.map((theme) => `- ${theme}`).join('\n')}

All attributes are optional and should be null if there is no value.
Do not include any information in your response that is not in the INPUT.

Your response will be parsed as JSON, so the entire response must be valid JSON and start with the character "{".
