 * for images) and 15 MB for audio it fetches from an HTTP URL — so 7 MB is the
 * smaller of the two documented inline figures and the one we hold ourselves
 * to rather than discovering the real number as a failed transcription. Base64
 * inflates the body by a third, which this is the raw-bytes side of.
 *
 * For scale: a ten-minute Opus voice note is well under 1 MB. A file that trips
 * this is a recording, not a message, and the honest answer is to say so.
