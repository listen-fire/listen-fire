// The querying handbook — chapters teaching how to ask, change, and
// trust data in the knowledge model through conversation. Mirrors the

// behind a thin index/lookup surface.
//
// Seeded from the teaching content the data assistant works from
// (lib/knowledge/query_agent.ts), rewritten for the person asking.

const PREFACE = `## Working with your data in conversation

The knowledge model is queried and edited by talking to the assistant:
ask questions in plain language, state facts to record them, and trace
any answer back to its source. These chapters cover how to aim a
question well, how changes work (and which instruction does what), and
how provenance lets you judge what an answer is worth.`;

const CONVENTIONS = `## Conventions (always in play)

- Ask in your model's vocabulary — its entity type, field, and
  relationship names.
- Conversation carries context: follow-ups apply to the answers on the
  table.
- Stated facts are recorded; ambiguous instructions come back as
  options.
- Every fact traces to a source — when a number matters, read where it
  came from.`;
