  content: `## Writes, handles, and identity

Use \`write\` to create or update a record in another system.

### writes

\`\`\`
company = write crm-[:Companies]-> {
  unique by (\`Domains\`)
  Name:    AI("the company name this email is about")
  Domains: [msg-[:Sender]->.domain]
}
\`\`\`

- The body maps the target's **writable fields** to expressions — only fields it declares, so read the schema rather than guess. Fill every one the source supports, and never invent a value to fill a slot.
- \`unique by (…)\` gives the record its identity, so a repeat event updates instead of duplicating.
- The assignment gives you a **handle**: a position in the target's graph carrying the written fields plus results like \`externalId\` and \`url\`, read like any position (\`company.url\`).
- A target may declare fields and connections its type **cannot exist without**; omit one and the write is flagged before it runs. Fix a missing connection by moving that parent into the write target (linked or tuple form, below); wrap a required field's \`AI()\` in \`COALESCE\`, since it can resolve to null.

### what-the-write-did

A handle carries what the write actually did, so a later message can say it honestly:

\`\`\`
Message: IF company.created THEN "Added \${company.\`Name\`}"
                            ELSE "Updated \${company.\`Name\`}" END
\`\`\`

\`created\` is \`TRUE\` when the write minted a new record, \`FALSE\` when it matched an existing one. \`committed\` is \`TRUE\` when it landed in the target system, \`FALSE\` when the instance was only rehearsing (\`dry_run: true\`).

### set-if-empty

\`?:\` sets a field **only when the target's current value is empty** — null or absent; an empty string counts as a value.

\`\`\`
write crm-[:Companies]-> {
  unique by (\`Name\`)
  Name:          msg.\`Subject\`
  Description ?: "Owner: \${@user_email}"
}
\`\`\`

Use it for defaults and one-time stamps — owners, "first seen" — and plain \`:\` where the source stays authoritative. \`?:\` also takes a value that may not be there, no guard needed: \`Description ?: FIRST(company.Domains)\`.

### append-to-a-multi-value-field

A plain \`:\` on a multi-valued field **replaces** the whole list. To add to it:

\`\`\`
Categories  +: ["inbound"]
Categories +?: [AI("a one-word category for this lead")]
\`\`\`

\`+:\` appends, duplicates and all; \`+?:\` appends only what's missing, so re-running never piles up duplicates. Both need a list — on a single-valued field they're flagged at save. Pair them with \`unique by\`, or the repeats land on different records with nothing to accumulate into.

A create writes into empty slots, so there every modifier — \`?:\`, \`+:\`, \`+?:\` — behaves like a plain \`:\`.

### structured-values

A few fields take a **structured value** — an object with named keys, nested as deep as it needs, because the target publishes its own document format. Write it inline as a literal, keys separated by commas:

\`\`\`
Layout: {
  heading: "\${company.\`Name\`} is ready",
  blocks: [{ kind: "text", value: "Approved by \${@user_email}" }]
}
\`\`\`

Nothing checks inside it — copy the shape from that system's documentation; a document it dislikes is its complaint at run time. **Opaque means pass-through and nothing else**: with no known shape the value can't be compared, added to, folded into a message, counted, or used as a condition, and each of those is refused as you write it.

### identity

\`\`\`
unique by (\`First Name\`, \`Last Name\`)
\`\`\`

- One clause is an AND-group — this one matches only when *both* do. Two clauses mean OR: match if either rule does.
- A component may be a **handle** rather than a field: \`unique by (parent, \`Stage\`)\` scopes identity to a parent, the way an order is unique *within* its customer.
- \`FUZZY\` matches a component by *similarity*: \`unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`)\` treats "Acme, Inc." and "Acme Inc" as one company. Use it on names and labels, never on ids or emails; not every target offers it.
- A \`FUZZY\` match is settled in two steps: the target surfaces the candidates by its own means, and a judge picks the best one, if any. A record the run built judges the same way.

Identity at write time is the **union** of the target's own rules and your \`unique by\`, so author only the identity the target lacks: compound business keys, parent-scoped identity, fields it treats as ordinary.

### match

Use \`match\` to find a record you will not create:

\`\`\`
company = match crm-[:Companies]-> {
  unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`)
  unique by (\`Domains\`)
  Name:    AI("the company name this email is about")
  Domains: [msg-[:Sender]->.domain]
}
\`\`\`

- The identity clauses work as in \`write\`: two clauses mean either, so this finds the company by a similar name or by its domain.
- The fields are the values to match on, and nothing is written, so \`?:\`, \`+:\` and \`+?:\` are refused.
- The lines after it run only when the record exists. On a miss the enclosing scope ends quietly: that iteration skips, or the run stops after the work already done.
- Written without a name (\`match crm-[:Companies]-> { … }\`), it is a gate: the rest of the block runs only if the record is there.
- The handle reads like a write's, without \`created\` and \`committed\`. A polymorphic edge takes the type explicitly: \`match a-[:related]-><Companies> { … }\`.
- Use \`write … unique by\` instead when the record should be created if it is missing.

\`FUZZY\` works only on the fields a target lists for similarity, and the save check names them. A valuations Legal Entity lists \`Name\`, \`Legal Name\`, \`Also Known As\` and \`Other Names\`: its shortlist searches the words in all four, plus near spellings of \`Name\` and \`Legal Name\`. Every other field matches exactly, and \`Website\` ignores the scheme, \`www.\` and a trailing slash.

### linked-writes

When the new record should hang off one you just wrote, target **an edge from the handle**:

\`\`\`
company = write crm-[:Companies]-> { unique by (\`Name\`), Name: enquiry.\`Company Name\` }

write company-[:Team]-> { Name: enquiry.\`Contact Name\` }
\`\`\`

One effect, two assertions: the record *and* its link from \`company\`. The type comes from the edge, so the child can't be authored without its connection. Chains compose, which is why you write parents first: every child hangs off a handle already in hand.

The edge may be declared on **either side**: where only the child references back, write it at the root and \`link\` it instead. Never put a handle in a reference-shaped *field* (\`Partner: pa\`) — connections live in the write target, not the body.

### conversation-writes

Posting to a chat system needs no special "send": a message is a record written along an edge, the same one you read coming in. What changes is only **what it hangs under** — its channel or thread comes from its parent, never from a field you fill in.

\`\`\`
deals = ONLY(chat-[ch:Channels WHERE \`Name\` == "deals"]->)
if deals == null { ERROR("no #deals channel") }
write deals-[:Messages]-> { Message: "A new company just landed." }

write msg-[:Replies]-> { Message: "Got it — taking a look now." }
\`\`\`

A reply hangs under the message that fired the automation, or one an earlier write sent back. What a system calls its message field, and which further edges it offers, is in that system's own chapter.

### multi-parent-writes

Some records sit at the convergence of *several* parents, none primary. Write the record once, with a **tuple of paths**:

\`\`\`
write (co-[:agreements]->, pa-[:agreements]->) {
  unique by (co, pa)
  Value: msg.\`Value\`
}
\`\`\`

Each path is a handle plus one edge its type declares, and the written type must be the **same** for every path: one record carrying N connections, not N records, created in one effect. \`unique by (co, pa)\` scopes its identity by all the parents at once.

### link

\`link\` connects two records you already hold, **without creating or modifying either one**.

\`\`\`
link champion -[:led]-> part

c = match p-[:Company]-> { unique by (\`Name\`), Name: "Acme" }
link p -[:Company]-> c
\`\`\`

Both ends are handles in the same graph, over an edge the from-side declares. To connect a record that exists but that you don't hold yet, \`match\` it first: \`Name\` selects Acme, it doesn't rename anything, and a miss skips the \`link\` with the rest of the scope.

### looking-up-existing-records

Look up a record that must already exist with \`ONLY\`, and guard it:

\`\`\`
company = ONLY(crm-[c:Companies WHERE \`Domains\` CONTAINS "acme.com"]->)
if company == null { ERROR("no company at acme.com") }
write company-[:Notes]-> { Title: "Enriched", Content: "found \${company.Name}" }
\`\`\`

The hop's \`WHERE\` is the criteria, rooted at any instance in scope. The guard ends the run with a reason when nothing matches.

So: a lookup finds a record that must be there, and a miss fails the run; \`match\` finds one that may not be, and a miss skips the rest of the scope; \`write … unique by\` finds *or creates*; \`write <alias>\` updates the exact record you already hold.

### updating-a-record-in-place

\`\`\`
crm-[record:Companies WHERE \`Categories\` == "Lead"]-> {
  write record { Categories: "Customer" }
}
\`\`\`

\`write <alias> { … }\` updates the record the alias already stands on — traversed, or a handle from earlier in the run. Nothing is left to resolve, so \`unique by\` is rejected, and there is no create to gate: set only the fields that change, and use \`link\`/\`unlink\` for connections. A target that can't update by id (an append-only channel, a drive that only creates files) is flagged at save.

### removal

\`\`\`
unlink company -[:related]-> stale     # sever the edge; both records remain
delete stale                           # remove the record itself
\`\`\`

\`unlink\` is the exact inverse of \`link\`'s handle form; severing an edge that isn't there is a quiet no-op. \`delete\` removes the record a position stands on, so it works wherever an in-place update does — reach for it only when removal is the point, never as cleanup for an identity you got wrong. Both are capability-gated: a target that can't sever or delete rejects the statement up front.`,
