  content: `## Extraction — structured records from unstructured data

\`extract(content, Shape, settings)\` turns text and documents into records you can walk and write from: one declared tree, one model call. For a single value — a summary, a category — use \`AI()\` instead.

### basics

\`\`\`
type Thesis = <"Consumer" | "Infra" | "Health">

node Company: "each company named in this message" {
  name:    <text> "the company's name"
  website: <text | null> "its website, if given"
  stage:   <crm-[:Onboarding]->.Stage> "how far along this company is"
  thesis:  <Thesis> "which of our theses it fits"
  node person: "each person at the company named in the message" {
    name:  <text> "the person's full name"
    email: <text | null> "their email address, if given"
  }
}

function \`Intake\`(m: <inbox-[:Email]->>) {
  content   = [m.\`Body\`, ...m-[a:Attachments]->.\`File\`]
  companies = extract(content, Company, { tier: 'careful' })

  MAP(companies, (c) => {
    record = write crm-[:Companies]-> { unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`), Name: c.name }
    write record-[:Lists]-> { listName: "Onboarding", Stage ?: c.stage }
    c-[p:person]-> {
      write record-[:Team]-> { unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`), Name: p.name, Email ?: p.email }
    }
  })
}
\`\`\`

- **Content** is a list, read in the order written: text, files (documents read as text, audio transcribed), and records rendered as text with \`TEXT.SERIALISE(record, 'JSON')\`. A record put in raw is refused when you save. Spread a list of files in with \`...\`.
- **The shape** is a node declaration: at the top of the file, inside the function or lambda that uses it, or written in place with its header — \`extract(content, node Person: "each person named" { name: <text> "their name" })\`. A shape worked out at run time is refused. Declare a record once and extract it anywhere; \`node X extends Company { … }\` adds fields for a later step (anatomy, *declared-structures*).
- **The description carries the cardinality**: "each company" yields every one, "the company" one. A record with nothing in any field is dropped. Where a record may genuinely not be there, say so — "the company, if mentioned" — or one gets invented to fill the slot.
- **Every field is something the model was asked for and may not have found.** A \`<text>\` field it did not find is \`""\`: test \`!= ""\` (a null test on it is refused). A \`<text | null>\` field arrives absent instead. A typed field (\`<number>\`, \`<date>\`, \`<boolean>\`, a set of values) is \`T | absent\`: write it with \`?:\`, fall back with \`COALESCE\`, or guard it (expressions, *values-that-may-not-be-there*).
- **A field's type is its annotation**: a primitive, a set of values you write (\`type Thesis = …\`), or a system field's type borrowed by path (\`<crm-[:Onboarding]->.Stage>\`). A set tells the model which values to pick from, and a value outside it is flagged when you save. A borrowed option field binds that field's live options, re-read every run. An annotation that disagrees with the field you write it into is flagged.
- **Nest a \`node\`** when a child only makes sense inside its parent. It arrives attached: walk it with \`c-[p:person]->\`.
- **The result** is a list of records. Read it with \`MAP\`, walk nested nodes, and write and link into it as into any record the run built. Each field's evidence names the content item it came from.
- **It is a value like any other**: \`MAP(extract(…), f)\`, \`return extract(…)\`, or bound when read more than once. It is refused inside a walk's \`WHERE\` and as a statement on its own line.
- Declare the records and fields you will use, not every one you could: a larger tree costs more.

\`extractOne(content, Shape, settings)\` gives the single record the content describes, as TypeScript's \`find\` sits beside \`filter\`:

\`\`\`
sender = extractOne(content, node Sender: "the company that sent this message" { name: <text> "its name" })
\`\`\`

- Describe the one thing (\`"the company"\`, not \`"each company…"\`). The result is \`Shape | absent\`; handle it like any maybe-absent value (\`COALESCE(sender.name, "unknown")\`, a guard).
- A reply naming several is tried once more, then the call fails.

A reply that does not fit the shape is tried once more, then the call fails. Inside \`MAP\`, \`onError: 'warn'\` leaves that record out and carries on.

### a-yes-or-no-field

\`\`\`
node Lead: "the company this email is about" {
  name:      <text> "the company's name"
  \`Is Warm\`: <boolean> "true when the sender already knows us — a referral, a reply to outreach, or a repeat contact; false otherwise"
}

lead = extractOne([m.\`Body\`], Lead)
if lead == null { ERROR("no company in this email") }
if lead.\`Is Warm\` {
  write crm-[:Companies]-> { unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`), Name: lead.name, Description: "Warm Lead" }
}
\`\`\`

A \`<boolean>\` field is the condition itself. A missing one reads as false; guard it with \`== null\` when "couldn't tell" should stop the run. A description that argues both ways gives the model a real decision rather than a value to lean toward.

### how-hard-it-works

\`tier\` says how much thinking the extraction is worth — the same three words \`AI()\` takes:

- \`'quick'\` — fast and cheap. Right when the values sit in the text and only have to be lifted out: names, dates, amounts.
- \`'careful'\` — a solid general answer. Right when a field calls for a small judgement, or the source is messy.
- \`'thorough'\` — slow and expensive, and it genuinely reasons. Worth it when a field must be worked out rather than found.

Leave it off and the extraction sizes itself from the tree you declared. \`model\` (a model this installation can reach, by name) and \`effort\` (\`'low'\`, \`'medium'\`, \`'high'\`, \`'xhigh'\`) override the tier's. An unknown setting, or an unreachable model, is refused when you save.

### repeated-calls

The model reads content it has already seen in this run for a fraction of the price, but only the part that comes first and is identical:

- Put what every call shares first and what belongs to one record last — \`[...content, TEXT.SERIALISE(c, 'JSON')]\`.
- Keep the tier (or the model and effort) the same across calls that read the same content.
- Give the \`MAP\` \`initialConcurrency: 1\`, so the first call has read the shared content before the rest start.

The shape always goes after the content, so a second extraction with a different shape over the same content is cheap too. The engine marks the cache itself; the order you write is the only thing to get right.

### enrichment

Enrich by composition: extract, map over the results, call plugins, extract again over what they returned, then merge.

\`\`\`
import { fetch_url, research } from plugins

node CompanyDetail: "the company" {
  summary: <text> "one line on what the company does"
}

node Detailed {
  name:    <text>
  website: <text | null>
  summary: <text | null>
  node person { name: <text> }
}

content   = [m.\`Body\`]
companies = extract(content, Company, { tier: 'careful' })

detailed = MAP(companies, { initialConcurrency: 1, concurrency: 4, onError: 'warn' }, (c) => {
  page    = fetch_url(url: c.website)
  more    = research(name: c.name, context: m.\`Subject\`, questions: "what the company does")
  details = extractOne([...content, TEXT.SERIALISE(c, 'JSON'), COALESCE(page, ""), COALESCE(more.dossier, "")], CompanyDetail, { tier: 'careful' })
  return graph<Detailed> { ...c, ...details }
})

MAP(detailed, (d) => {
  record = write crm-[:Companies]-> { unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`), Name: d.name, Description ?: d.summary }
  d-[p:person]-> { write record-[:Team]-> { unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`), Name: p.name } }
})
\`\`\`

- A plugin is imported (\`import { fetch_url } from plugins\`) and called with named arguments. It returns a value: \`fetch_url\` the page's text, \`research\` a record read by name (\`more.summary\`, \`more.dossier\`). Anything it found nothing for is absent, so \`COALESCE\` it before it goes into content. Each plugin's own chapter (\`plugin:…\`) says what it takes and returns.
- \`graph<Detailed> { ...c, ...details }\` copies the record and then its detail as a snapshot you can walk and write from; the declaration decides which fields, and a nested node is followed through the record's edge of the same name. A later field wins.
- \`details\` may be absent, so a field only it supplies may be too. A required field fed from it is refused when you save: declare it \`<text | null>\`, or write it after the spread with a fallback (\`summary: COALESCE(details.summary, "")\`).
- \`{ ...c, ...details }\` builds a dict instead, read with a dot. Use it when nothing needs to walk the result.

### long-documents

Cut a long document into pieces, read each on its own, and gather what they found before any of it reaches a system:

\`\`\`
node Found {
  node companies {
    name:    <text>
    website: <text | null>
  }
}

pieces  = CHUNKS(COALESCE(READ(FIRST(docs)), ""), { size: 40000, overlap: 2000 })
deduped = graph<Found> {}

MAP(pieces, (p) => {
  MAP(extract([p], Company, { tier: 'quick' }), (c) => {
    write deduped-[:companies]-> { unique by (FUZZY name), name: c.name, website ?: c.website }
  })
})

deduped-[c:companies ORDER BY \`name\`]-> {
  write crm-[:Companies]-> { unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`), Name: c.name }
}
\`\`\`

- \`extract(pieces, …)\` is ONE extraction reading every piece; the \`MAP\` makes one per piece.
- A write into the local graph merges by \`unique by\`, so a company found in two pieces lands once.
- When a run says a reading was *continued*, the answer ran past its output ceiling: cut smaller. \`CHUNKS(text, { entities: 20 })\` sizes each piece by the records it is expected to hold.

### attaching-the-source-files

The files an extraction read are the ones you put in its content, so attach them from where they came:

\`\`\`
record = write crm-[:Companies]-> { unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`), Name: c.name }
m-[a:Attachments]-> {
  write record-[:Files]-> { File: a.\`File\` }
}
\`\`\`

A document a plugin downloaded comes back on its result (\`vc_url_retrieval\`'s \`file\`), and is written the same way.
