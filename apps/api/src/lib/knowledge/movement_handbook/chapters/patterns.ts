  content: `## Common patterns

Reach for the shape that matches the brief. Each is an idiom, not a whole file — the surrounding imports, constructions, and \`listen\` line are the anatomy chapter's job, and every type and field name here is illustrative.

### inbound-intake

Something arrives, a record is created or updated, the team is told.

\`\`\`
person = write crm-[:People]-> {
  unique by (\`Email\`)
  Email: msg.\`From\`
  Name:  COALESCE(AI("the sender's name, cleaned — no email address, no 'via', no company suffix: \${msg.\`From\`}"), msg.\`From\`)
}

intake = ONLY(chat-[ch:Channels WHERE \`Name\` == "intake"]->)
if intake == null { ERROR("no #intake channel") }
write intake-[:Messages]-> { Message: "New sender: \${msg.\`From\`} (\${person.externalId})" }
\`\`\`

Key the identity on something actually carried in the message, so a second arrival updates rather than duplicates. The \`AI()\` touch is a micro-judgement — tidying a display name; pulling an entity *out of* the prose would be an \`extract\` job — and it is wrapped in \`COALESCE\` because \`Name\` is required and a judgement can come back with nothing.

### multi-target

Several systems hearing one event is several writes in one body; a later write quotes an earlier handle.

\`\`\`
record = write crm-[:Companies]-> { … }

ops = ONLY(chat-[ch:Channels WHERE \`Name\` == "ops"]->)
if ops == null { ERROR("no #ops channel") }
write ops-[:Messages]-> { Message: "Logged to the CRM: \${record.externalId}" }
\`\`\`

For writes that genuinely don't depend on each other, \`parallel\` runs them at once:

\`\`\`
await parallel([
  () => { write crm-[:Companies]-> { unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`), Name: msg.\`Subject\` } },
  () => { write sheet-[:Rows]->    { unique by (\`Company\`),    Company: msg.\`Subject\` } },
])
\`\`\`

Each arm is a **function** — \`() => { … }\` written where it stands, or the name of one declared elsewhere — and \`await\` is what waits, here until every arm has finished. An arm reads anything bound before the \`parallel\` and never another arm's bindings. Work that has to come back out is \`return\`ed: the value is a receipt with one slot per arm in the order written, and \`AT(r, 0)\` reads the first arm's slot. Arms that only act need no binding at all, as here.

### compose-a-report

Many small things into one readable artifact: a block returns a line each, \`JOIN\` assembles them, \`FILE\` turns the text into a file for a file-typed field.

\`\`\`
lines = msg-[f:Attachments]-> {
  return "- \${f.\`Name\`}"
}

digest = "Attachments on \${msg.\`Subject\`}:
\${JOIN(lines, "\\n")}"

write record-[:Files]-> { File: FILE(digest, "pdf") }
\`\`\`

\`FILE\` renders the string exactly as composed, so the layout you write is the layout in the file. Anything a block can iterate — extracted entities included — can feed one.

### scheduled-digest

A schedule fires, a query gathers, a message goes out. The tick carries nothing you need — the query is the input.

\`\`\`
function \`Weekly Digest\`(t: <timer-[:Tick]->>) {
  lines = crm-[c:Companies WHERE \`Created At\` WITHIN 7d ORDER BY \`Created At\` DESC LIMIT 20]-> {
    return "- \${c.\`Name\`}"
  }

  ops = ONLY(chat-[ch:Channels WHERE \`Name\` == "ops"]->)
  if ops == null { ERROR("no #ops channel") }
  write ops-[:Messages]-> { Message: "New this week:\\n\${JOIN(lines, "\\n")}" }
}

listen as "Weekly digest" to timer { schedule: "0 9 * * 1" } fire \`Weekly Digest\`
\`\`\`

### sections-from-a-type

A report whose sections come from a **type** rather than from a list written beside it: group the findings by the value, walk the type's members in the order they were declared, and look each group up.

\`\`\`
type Thesis = <"Consumer" | "Infra" | "Health">

node Finding: "each company mentioned" {
  headline: <text> "one line about it"
  thesis:   <Thesis> "which thesis it fits"
}

function \`Thesis Recap\`(go: <runs-[:Invocation]->>) {
  found    = extract([go.\`Text\`], Finding)
  rows     = MAP(found, (f) => { return { thesis: COALESCE(f.thesis, "Consumer"), line: f.headline } })
  by       = GROUPBY(rows, (r) => r.thesis)
  sections = MAP(MEMBERS(<Thesis>), (th) => "\${th}: \${COUNT(COALESCE(AT(by, th), []))} found")

  ops = ONLY(chat-[ch:Channels WHERE \`Name\` == "ops"]->)
  if ops == null { ERROR("no #ops channel") }
  write ops-[:Messages]-> { Message: JOIN(sections, "\\n") }
}
\`\`\`

- Adding a thesis is one edit — the declaration — and the report grows a section on its own, in the place the declaration puts it. A thesis nothing matched is an ordinary missing lookup, so it still gets its line.
- A thesis the model could not settle on is defaulted on the way into the row. The headline needs no default — a text field it did not find is \`""\`.

### extract-and-connect

Records pulled out of a message and written **with their relationships intact**: the people are declared inside the company, so each one lands attached to the right one.

\`\`\`
import { vc_url_retrieval } from plugins

node Company: "each company this message is about" {
  name:    <text> "the company's name"
  website: <text> "the company's official website"
  node person: "each person at this company named in the message" {
    name:      <text> "the person's full name"
    job_title: <text | null> "the person's job title, if given"
  }
}

pages     = vc_url_retrieval(text: msg.\`Body\`)
content   = [msg.\`Body\`, ...MAP(pages, (p) => COALESCE(p.text, ""))]
companies = extract(content, Company, { tier: 'careful' })

MAP(companies, (c) => {
  company = write crm-[:Companies]-> { unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`), Name: c.name, Domains: c.website }
  c-[p:person]-> {
    write company-[:Team]-> { unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`), Name: p.name, \`Job Title\` ?: p.job_title }
  }
})
\`\`\`

Two things here you cannot derive:

- **Linked pages go into the content.** \`vc_url_retrieval\` loads the pages and documents the message links to, so \`website\` comes from the page rather than a guess. Per-record enrichment — a lookup per company found — is a plugin call inside the \`MAP\` and a second extraction (extraction, *enrichment*).
- **Which side declares the edge decides the shape of the write.** Where the parent declares it — as here — a linked write off the parent's handle is the one idiomatic form. Where only the child declares a reference back, write the child at the root and connect it with \`link\`. Read your catalog: that is the system's choice, not yours.

### declare-once

The same record extracted in several places, written the same way each time — declare it once, with its words, and reuse it:

\`\`\`
node Entry: "each company named in this text" {
  Name:        <text> "the company's name"
  Description: <text> "what the company does, in one sentence"
  node person: "each person at the company" { Name: <text> "their full name" }
}

function \`Intake\`(go: <runs-[:Invocation]->>) {
  found = extract([go.\`Text\`], Entry, { tier: 'careful' })
  MAP(found, (e: <Entry>) => {
    company = write crm-[:Companies]-> { unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`), ?...e }
    e-[p:person]-> { write company-[:Team]-> { unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`), ?...p } }
  })
}
\`\`\`

- The declaration is the one place the record's fields and words live; every extraction that names it reads it the same way.
- A step that needs one field more extends the declaration rather than copying it: \`node <name> extends Entry { … }\` (anatomy chapter, *declared-structures*).
- \`?...e\` writes each field set-if-empty, so the declaration's field names are the target's. It carries only fields — \`person\` is its own write — and a field the target lacks is flagged by name.
- Identity needs no line of its own: \`unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`)\` matches on the \`Name\` the spread writes.
- The same spread takes a parameter typed on a declaration (\`d: <Entry>\`) or a graph you built — any record whose fields the automation spells out. A record read from a system is written field by field.

### human-reviewed-intake

"Let me paste something in, but let me check it before it's saved."

\`\`\`
found = extract([go.\`Text\`, ...go-[:Files]->.\`File\`], Company)

q = write asks-[:Check]-> {
  Prompt: "Save these companies and people?"
  Detail: "Review the extracted records before they're written."
}

answer = await FIRST(q-[:Response]->)
if answer.Answer {
  MAP(found, (c) => { … })
}
\`\`\`

Two things make it this shape rather than a thinner one:

- **The raw input flows in.** What the person pasted and each file they dropped go into the source list undigested — not read, tidied, and re-typed somewhere else first.
- **The review happens inside.** The person approves the automation's *own* extracted values, not a rendering of them made somewhere else. The tempting alternative — read the pasted text outside, pull the records out yourself, show a tidied-up version, then run a write-only automation — throws the real input away and reviews the wrong thing.
