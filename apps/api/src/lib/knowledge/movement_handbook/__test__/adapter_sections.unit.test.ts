// Adapter-declared handbook sections — the MACHINERY, not Slack's prose.
//
// A system's conceptual documentation is registered on its manifest and
// assembled into the automation book at read time, so the path under test is
// manifest → chapter → shelf. The manifest here is synthetic on purpose: a
// test that only ever asserted the registered adapters would pass on the day
// the assembly stopped reading manifests at all, as long as Slack happened to
// still be listed somewhere.
//
// The prose contract is asserted BOTH ways — a well-written section holds it,
// and a sloppy one is caught — because a rule that never fails is a rule
// nobody can trust to be running.
