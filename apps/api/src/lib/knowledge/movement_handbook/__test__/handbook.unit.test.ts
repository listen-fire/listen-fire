// clean, yet the real CHECKER rejects it (MOV_EXPR_PARSE). So an example
// that claims to RUN must be validated against the real checker.
//
// TWO THINGS MAKE THIS BITE, and both were missing when the handbook rotted:
//
// 1. COVERAGE IS OPT-OUT, NOT OPT-IN. Every `status:'runs'` probe is checked;
//    a probe escapes only by being listed in CHECKER_EXEMPT with a reason, and
//    that list is itself asserted to stay small. The old model was an opt-in
//    list with ONE entry against ~50 runnable examples, which is why 87
//    occurrences of two retired constructs survived: nothing compared the other
//    49 to anything.
//
// 2. THE FIXTURE IS CAPTURED FROM THE REAL ADAPTERS, NOT HAND-WRITTEN.
//    `adapter_schemas.fixture.json` is the live output of the real catalog
//    projection for the dev-loop workspace — regenerate it against a running
//    dev loop with
//
//        pnpm dev:movement snapshot-catalog --handbook \
//          --out <this dir>/adapter_schemas.fixture.json
//
//    A hand-written fixture validates an example against a shape someone
//    imagined, which is validation theatre: the previous fixture declared
//    `Companies -[:People]-> People`, an edge REAL Attio does not have (its
//    reference lives on the child, `People -[:Company]-> Companies`), so an
//    example could pass this test and still be untrue. Captured schemas make
//    "passes the test" and "true about the adapter" the same statement, and an
//    adapter that changes shape fails every example the change invalidated.
//
//    `--handbook` is what makes that capture honest, and it is not a
//    convenience flag. It drives the capture from THESE PROBES — the same
//    `engineClaims` the test below checks — through the very catalog build a
//    save performs, so what gets described is what the examples demand. The
//    flagless form is a full-surface sweep, which no save has ever done and
//    which a container-shaped system (Attio) refuses outright: swept, every
//    Attio position came back `undescribed` and every example naming
//    `Companies` failed on a position nobody had looked at. So the fixture is
//    the UNION of what the handbook's own examples demand, and an example that
//    names something no example demands is an example the fixture cannot back.

// The traversal chapter teaches which aggregates may read which relationships,
// and the teaching is only worth anything if the captured schemas back it. So
// the refusals are pinned here, on the same fixture the examples are checked
// against: an order the source does not have cannot be borrowed by writing
// `FIRST`, and a source that DOES keep an order needs no `ORDER BY` to prove it.
