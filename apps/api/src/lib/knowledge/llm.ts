// Knowledge's own model call, and the sink it reports what it spent to.
//
// D12: a shared LLM helper is a coupling every product inherits, so each unit
// vendors its own small one instead. This is knowledge's — the ~120 lines it
// actually needs, reporting usage through an interface rather than reaching for
// automations' metering, its wallet, its cost meter or its cancel gate. The
// composition root is the only place that knows both sides and wires them
// together; a standalone knowledge simply has no sink and records nothing.
//
// Degradation is LOUD and it is the caller's to handle (D42): no key configured
// is `null` from `knowledgeLlmKey()`, not a throw at import and not a silent
// call that fails at the vendor. The arbitration worker reads that and lets its
// queue grow visibly rather than burning attempts on a call that cannot succeed.
