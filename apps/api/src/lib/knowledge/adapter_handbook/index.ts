// The adapter-authoring handbook — chapters teaching how to build a
// remote adapter: an HTTP server that speaks Listen-Fire's small JSON
// protocol so a self-hosted system reads and writes like a built-in
// integration. Mirrors the query_handbook registry pattern:
// consumer-neutral chapter bodies behind a thin index/lookup surface.
//
// This handbook IS the canonical builder kit — the single source, served
// over MCP (`readHandbook`). The intended distribution is: a user connects
// the MCP and points their own agent at this book, rather than us sharing a
// doc. (Future: generate public docs pages from the handbooks.)

const PREFACE = `## Building a remote adapter

A remote adapter is an HTTP server you host that lets Listen-Fire read from and
write to your own system — a homespun CRM, an internal tool, any
HTTP-reachable data store — as if it were a built-in integration. You do
not need anything from Listen-Fire's codebase: the adapter just speaks a small
JSON protocol, and any language works. These chapters cover what an
adapter is, the wire protocol, how to describe your data model, and a
runnable reference server with the manifest that registers it.`;

const CONVENTIONS = `## Conventions (always in play)

- One HTTP endpoint answers every method; the method name is in the
  request body, not the path.
- Application results and application errors both return HTTP 200 — an
  envelope's \`ok\` flag says which. Reserve non-200 for transport
  faults (401 auth, 400 malformed).
- Listen-Fire speaks your natural type and field names on the wire; your
  server maps them to whatever your system uses internally.
- Declare exactly the methods you implement — Listen-Fire never calls one you
  did not declare.
- The secret is entered into Listen-Fire separately and stored encrypted; it
  never lives in the manifest.`;
