/**
 * What every inbound webhook door does when it has NO secret to verify against.
 *
 * The doors used to answer this themselves, identically and wrongly: reject in
 * production, allow everywhere else. "Everywhere else" is any staging box, any
 * review app, any laptop with a tunnel — each of which is on the public
 * internet with an unauthenticated ingress that fires real automations. NODE_ENV
 * is a build flag, not a network boundary.
 *
 * So it fails CLOSED, and the dev loop (which injects unsigned Slack, Telegram
 * and WhatsApp deliveries) opens it EXPLICITLY with `ALLOW_UNSIGNED_WEBHOOKS`.
 * The bypass never applies in production, whatever the variable says — an
 * environment that can be talked into accepting forged deliveries by setting
 * one env var is not fail-closed — and it says so out loud, once per door, so
 * an operator who set it for a laptop and inherited it on a shared box finds
 * the reason in the logs rather than in an incident.
 *
 * One helper, one rule: the doors differ in how they verify a secret they HAVE,
 * never in what they do without one.
