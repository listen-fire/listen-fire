 * The production/staging stand-in for missing outbound-WhatsApp config —
 * TWILIO_NUMBER, TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID or TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, none of which has a
 * safe default and any of which alone cannot send. Production used to fall back
 * to the fake adapter, which POSTs at a localhost outbox that isn't there and
 * returns `true` anyway — so every production WhatsApp message evaporated while
 * reporting success. This fails loudly instead: callers see `false` and can act
 * on an undeliverable message rather than believing a delivered one.
