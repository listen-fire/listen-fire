// The Affinity client counts every request it actually puts on the wire
// against the run's ceiling, and stops the run once it is over.
//
// Two things are easy to get wrong and are asserted here: the ceiling is
// charged where the call is ISSUED (the client is a process-wide singleton
// behind a shared queue, so the run has to be captured, not looked up when the
// job eventually executes), and the ceiling error is TERMINAL — the retry loop
// must not spend four more attempts on the very error that exists to stop
// spending.
