// How THIS deployment connects a Gmail mailbox, and which scopes it asks for.
//
// Two methods, and the difference is who enforces the boundary:
//
//   oauth (the default) — somebody signs in AS the mailbox. Google hands back a
//     refresh token that works for that one mailbox and no other, so the
//     boundary is Google's and cannot be widened from here.
//   delegated — the deployment's service account acts as an address it was
//     never signed into, granted once by a Workspace admin. That grant covers
//     EVERY mailbox in the Workspace, so the boundary is entirely ours.
//
// Everything downstream that differs between the two — which connect form is
// offered, which credential shape is stored, whether an unset allowlist is safe
// — reads the method from here rather than re-deriving it.
