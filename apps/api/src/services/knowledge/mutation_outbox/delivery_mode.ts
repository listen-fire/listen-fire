// Which way a drained mutation event leaves knowledge. Read at the composition
// root, and again by the drainer for every row it delivers.
//
// A deployment has EXACTLY ONE active path: composed runs the local subscriber
// the composition root registers (no HTTP hop); standalone runs the registered
// webhooks, because automations is a different process. Delivering both for the
// same row is a double-fire — the listener runs twice off one graph write — so
// the choice is a mode, not a pair of independently-enabled features.
//
// Composed is the shipped deployment, so an absent variable means `local`. An
// unrecognised one is a boot failure rather than a quiet fall back to it: the
// two modes are different delivery guarantees, and a typo must not pick one.
