// The movement engine (E1) — direct execution of the checked movement
// AST, no TG lowering. An interpreter walks the movement body in program
// order with an Environment of bindings → runtime values; the TG
// data-model (action trees, sibling roots, action_result nodes) never
// appears in the path.
//
// The engine is new; the platform isn't. Reused substrate:
//   - the adapter layer wholesale, resolved through the SAME
//     `resolveAdapter` seam `evaluateTranslationGraph` / provision use
//     (so simulate / tests inject fakes identically);
//   - the dry-run wrapper (`engine/dry_run_adapter.ts`) — CapturedWrite
//     output is the same currency as M4b/M5 dry runs;
//   - the entity-resolution split: the adapter returns a candidate
//     shortlist, the shared arbitration module
//     (`engine/entity_match.ts:arbitrateEntityCandidates`, extracted
//     from `applyActionPlan` for exactly this reuse) decides
//     create-vs-update;
//   - the trigger seed: the event position mirrors the TG engine's
//     `seedRootSourcePosition` webhook branch, so source-property reads
//     hit the adapter with an identical position.
//
// E1 statement subset: assignment (construction / write / expression),
// unbound writes, instance-target writes with `unique by`, `if` with
// expression conditions. E2 adds extraction (`extract … { }` planned +
// materialised by `./extraction.ts`) and traversal-headed blocks (per-
// emission iteration over extract edges and `#resources`, meta-node
// accumulation). E3 makes the knowledge graph an ordinary write target
// (the KG adapter resolves through the same seam — see `./kg.ts`), adds
// linked writes (`write h-[:edge]-> { … }` — create the record AND the
// connecting edge in one effect, written type inferred from the parent's
// graph schema) with edge-scoped compound identity (`unique by (h,
// `field`)` folds the parent's record into the resolve as the edge-scoped
// neighbour). E4 makes
// provenance the value model: every evaluation is `(value, provenance)`
// (see ./provenance.ts), writes translate faithful trails into
// `WriteInput.evidence` (the KG adapter persists them as its native
// evidence rows — closing the E3 parity gap with the TG path), and
// every write's per-field trails land summarised on
// `MovementRunResult.writes` for trigger_run recording. E5 adds
// composition (§G): same-file movement calls with lexical callee
// environments (a fresh child of FILE scope — caller locals invisible
// by construction), argument adaptation via in-memory shape writes
// (shapes are configuration-free graphs — no adapter, no firing-record
// write; the position carries its fields' trails), AI() through the
// LlmClient seam (see ./expression.ts), and runtime IS tests against
// the runtime position's type where the engine knows it. E6 adds the
// source-graph traversal slice: meta-rooted movements (`movement
// backfill(root: crm)` under a `snapshot` event seed the adapter's meta
// position — the manual_run.ts backfill shape), traversal-headed blocks
// over ADAPTER edges (`root-[c:companies]-> { … }` streams positions
// through the source adapter's iterateRelated/getRelated — the same
// seam the TG engine's snapshot fan-out walks; event schema-edge heads
// ride it too), per-hop WHERE filters evaluated position-scoped, and
// runtime EXISTS() (see ./expression.ts). Writes inside an adapter-edge
// iteration stand on the iterated record, so KG creates bridge to it
// exactly as the TG engine's collection fan-out does. E7 lifts standalone
// edge statements (`edge a -[:e]-> b`, §B "the rare case"): both names
// must be write handles in the SAME graph, the edge resolves against the
// from-side's type, and the assert goes through the new optional
// `Adapter.linkRecords` seam (KG: edge-only insert mirroring parentLink;
// Attio: reference-field set/append) — adapters without the capability
// are rejected by name. E8 lifts file imports (movement libraries, §H):
// `RunMovementInput.resolveFile` is the one injection point — resolution
// lives in movement-lang (`checkProgramWithLink` validates and returns
// the link), imported movements execute against their library's OWN file
// environment (built once per path), imported shapes bind as
// declarations. Everything still outside the slice (kg-seeded movements)
// raises a clean MOVENG_UNSUPPORTED naming the construct.

   * Scheduling. The first `initialConcurrency` members are a batch of their
   * own: it runs to the end before any other member starts, so whatever the
   * first members make shared (a cached prompt) is in place for the rest. The
   * rest then run `concurrency` at a time, each slot taking the next member as
   * soon as its last one finishes. With neither set, that is one member at a
   * time, in order — what every op did before it could be told otherwise.
   *
   * Each member runs in a frame of its own (`MemberFrame`): its own copy of the
   * call stack, and its own trace, spliced into the enclosing trace in member
   * order as the members before it finish. What members do to the WORLD is put
   * in a queue instead (`oneEffectAtATime`), because a write's identity is a
   * find-then-create, and two members creating the same record at once would
   * each find nothing and each create it.
   *
   * Failure. A member's function failing is a fact about that member, and
   * `onError` says what it does: `error` fails the run (as it always has),
   * `warn` and `ignore` leave the member out of the answer — `warn` putting a
   * warning in the trace where the member's entries are. Only a member's own
   * failure is forgiven. A run being cancelled, the run's call ceiling, a
   * member parking (which the checker refuses), and a `match` that found
   * nothing ending the scope quietly are the RUN's control flow, not a member
   * failing, and pass through whatever `onError` says.
   *
   * When the op does fail, no further member starts, the members already
   * running finish (their effects have happened, and the run's ledger has to
   * hold them), and the failure re-thrown is the earliest MEMBER's — the one a
   * one-at-a-time run would have stopped at.

 * separate question, and it is the trace's, not the program's.
