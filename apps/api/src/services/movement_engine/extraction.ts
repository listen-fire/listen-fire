// Movement engine — the extraction planner + materialiser (E2).
//
// `extract from [data…] { tree }` is a MATERIALISATION: it plans LLM
// phases over the authored tree, runs them, and yields an ephemeral
// result graph (`ExtractEmission`) that the interpreter binds as an
// `extractRoot` and traverses like any other graph.
//
// Planning model (knowledge-pipeline skeleton, author-fenced):
//   - The author's `through` fences are THE ONLY phase boundary. A
//     through-free (sub)tree is ONE LLM call regardless of nesting
//     depth — children nest as arrays inside their parent's emitted
//     entities, so parent↔child association costs nothing.
//   - A `through` pipeline runs PER ENTITY between its node's stages
//     (progressive per-entity branching): the fenced stage re-extracts
//     against the original data plus the entity's accumulated fields
//     plus the plugins' outputs, so deeper nodes see enriched context.
//   - A stage INHERITS the fields of the stage before it and declares
//     only what it transforms, so a node's shape is every field it
//     declares anywhere; a re-declaration is the transformation, and
//     the later stage's value is the one exported.
//
// Runtime conventions are the TG batched-extraction module's
// (`engine/batched_extraction/`): the same pluggable `LlmClient`, the
// same `{ evidence, value }` field wrapping, the same entity-guide
// line shapes, the same validate-then-retry-once loop, the same
// entity-density model selection. What is NEW here is the phase
// planner and the nested (tree-shaped) response schema — the TG
// engine runs one call per `#extract` site; this planner batches a
// whole through-free region into one.
//
// `through` plugins are the TG transform registry's implementations,
// invoked exactly like the TG engine's entity-enrichment cycle invokes
// them (`kind: 'context-dependent'`, outputs projected from
// `result.properties`) — injectable for tests.
//
// Field types (incl. enum options) come from EXPLICIT annotations only —
// a primitive name (`amount: number "…"`) or a BORROWED dotted path
// (`stage: crm.companies.funding_stage "…"`) resolved against the live
// instance schema at every firing (the checker's borrow resolution,
// mirrored runtime-side). Backward adoption from typed write targets is
// DEMOTED (explicit over implicit, 3_syntax_sketch.md "Borrowed types
// and enums"): the checker suggests the annotation; only the annotation
// constrains what reaches the LLM.
