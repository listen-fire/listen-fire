// The per-frame pending-count completion mechanism (async user interaction §5.4,
// chunk 3.2b). A parallel / fan-out JOIN frame holds a count of its unresolved
// child branches; resolving a child is the atomic
//   UPDATE join_pending SET pending = pending - 1 … RETURNING pending
// and the decrement that returns 0 is the UNIQUE, race-free completer (no
// read-then-claim, no separate marker — the counter IS the claim). The completer
// deletes the row, hoists the join, and runs the enclosing sequence forward,
// which may complete the parent frame and decrement ITS join, cascading up.
//
// This dissolves "join completion" into the decrement: "am I the last child?" is
// answered by the row-level UPDATE, so two siblings answered in the same window
// never both complete the join. A leaf with no enclosing join (a single linear
// ask) has no row — `decrementJoin` is never called for it; it completes directly.

/**
 * The mark-closed decrement (design §6.4) — the engine-side replacement for
 * `decrementJoin` used by the resume unwind. Unlike the delete-on-zero
 * `decrementJoin` above, this KEEPS the join_pending row on close and marks the
 * closing leaf's address in `closed_by_address`, so the closer is durably
 * identifiable across a crash (§7): the closer re-scanned after a crash sees its
 * own address and re-runs the continuation; a sibling never does.
 *
 * Per-leaf EXACTLY-ONCE (§7 residual, now CLOSED). Each branch's decrement is
 * claimed atomically against its own `join_branch_export` row (written
 * persist-before-decrement, run.ts) via `decremented = true`. A non-closer
 * re-scanned in the crash window between its decrement and its `parked_run`
 * delete would otherwise decrement the join a SECOND time → close it EARLY (the
 * closer folds an incomplete aggregate; the genuinely-last sibling hits a closed
 * join and loses its export + continuation). The claim guards against exactly
 * that: only the FIRST decrement per branch touches the pending count.
 *
 * In one transaction:
 *  - CLAIM: `UPDATE join_branch_export SET decremented = true WHERE … AND
 *    branch_address = :branchAddress AND decremented = false RETURNING 1`.
 *  - if CLAIMED (first time for this branch) → the existing decrement logic:
 *    `UPDATE join_pending … pending - 1 … WHERE pending > 0 RETURNING pending`;
 *    reached 0 → mark `closed_by_address` (row retained) → `{ closed: true }`;
 *    still > 0 → `{ closed: false }`.
 *  - if NOT claimed (already decremented on a prior run — crash retry) → DO NOT
 *    decrement again; re-scan `closed_by_address`: the re-scanned closer (its own
 *    address) ⇒ `{ closed: true }`; a sibling / missing row ⇒ `{ closed: false }`.
 *
 * The claim requires the export row to exist first — it always does
 * (persist-before-decrement, run.ts unwindSpine). Claim + decrement are in one
 * transaction so they are atomic together.
