// The await-resume worker (asks-as-adapter §A) — the engine half of the
// awaitable capability, adapter-agnostic. Two entry points, ONE drive:
//   • POLL (ask): `resumeAwaitedRuns` finds parks whose ask has SETTLED
//     (answered / expired) via the settled-state join and drives each run.
//   • EVENT (Slack, and any watch-point adapter): `resumeAwaitsForCorrelation`
//     is called from the inbound seam when a signal lands on an adapter identity
//     (`channel:thread_ts`); it drives the parks correlated to that identity.
// Both feed `resumeAwaitRun`, which RE-ENTERS each leaf at its await (the await
// re-checks the edge live via `resolveAwait` and binds its own landing) rather
// than injecting an answer.
//
// F21 (batched resume, one movement instance at a time): the single-flight
// per-run slot resumes one run at a time; each of a run's resolvable leaves is
// stepped forward in turn, so a multi-winner tie (F18) settles in one batch. A
// crash mid-drain leaves the `adapter_await` rows for the next pass to
// re-process (idempotent — a resolved leaf has no parked_run left).
