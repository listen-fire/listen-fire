// The cooperative cancel gate (runs-and-cancel spec §cancel). The engine checks
// it at statement boundaries AND at the boundaries inside a statement — every
// LLM call and every plugin invocation of an extraction — because cancel means
// "stop doing things", not just "stop spending", and one `extract` statement can
// be minutes of work. All of them share this ONE debounced read, so the extra
// check sites cost nothing: within POLL_MS the answer is served from memory, and
// once cancelled it latches and never reads again. Fail-open: a read fault reads
// as not-cancelled, the same posture as the dispatch gates (a DB blip must not
// kill healthy runs).

/**
 * Thrown when the user requested cancellation (runs-and-cancel spec §cancel) —
 * at a statement boundary (the interpreter's cancel gate) or an LLM-call
 * boundary (the `LlmClient` seam). Caught at the top of `run()`/`resume()` (like
 * `RunParked`), NEVER by the fan-out/parallel park machinery (which special-case
 * only `RunParked`/`ScopeEndedQuietly`, so this propagates). It lives beside the
 * gate that raises it, and both `run.ts` and `extraction.ts` import it from here
 * so neither takes on a run↔extraction cycle. Re-exported from `run.ts` for the
 * engine's public surface.
