// Movement engine — expression evaluation against the interpreter's
// Environment (E1).
//
// A NEW evaluator over the bridge-parsed formula AST
// (`parseMovementExpression` → the shared `Expression` union). It is NOT
// the TG engine's evaluator: alias roots resolve against movement
// bindings (the event parameter, write handles, plain values) instead of
// TG `ctx.aliases`, and write-handle reads resolve env-side — there are
// no `action_result` nodes and no TG EvalContext anywhere in the path.
//
// What IS reused from the TG substrate:
//   - the source-position read primitive: property reads on the event
//     payload go through `sourceAdapter.getFieldValue({ position,
//     fieldId })` against the same seeded trigger position the TG engine
//     builds (`run.ts` mirrors `seedRootSourcePosition`'s webhook
//     branch) — so an adapter's read semantics are identical under both
//     engines;
//   - operator semantics (`compareValues`, concat null-folding, logical
//     truthiness, arithmetic) are mirrored verbatim from
//     `engine/expression.ts` so a condition or field value computes the
//     same answer under both engines. Mirrored as local copies rather
//     than imports — the TG engine module is frozen and its helpers are
//     private.
//
// E2 adds the extraction-side reads: extract-position field reads,
// traversal over extract edges, block meta-node reads (accumulated
// bindings as edges, POSITION_SENTINEL as "the positions themselves"),
// resource field reads, and the aggregate family mirrored from the TG
// engine's `applyAggregation`. E5 adds `AI()` — the frozen TG engine's
// `llm` semantics (the author's prompt, or `String(promptExpression)`,
// as ONE user message; the reply string is the value), routed through
// the E2 `LlmClient` seam instead of the frozen path's hardwired
// `openAiChat` — plus bare-name value-binding reads (`AI(company_prompt)`
// — the bridge parses a bare name as a `property` node) and in-memory
// shape positions (the composition argument currency, see run.ts).
// Everything still outside the slice raises a loud MOVENG_UNSUPPORTED
// naming the construct.
//
// E4 — provenance is the value model: the core evaluator
// (`evalMovementExpr`) returns `(value, provenance)` pairs. Values stay
// plain (equality/comparison ignore provenance by construction);
// trails ride alongside, unioned taint-style at every operator and
// kept `direct` only while a value flows un-transformed from its
// origin (see ./provenance.ts). `evaluateMovementExpression` remains
// the value-only entry point for callers that don't consume trails
// (conditions).
//
// E6 adds the source-graph read surface:
//   - `sourcePosition` bindings — records yielded by an adapter-edge
//     block head (a collection fan-out from the meta root, an event
//     schema-edge walk) read through the SAME `getFieldValue` seam as
//     the event position;
//   - position-scoped sub-evaluation (`ctx.scope`) — WHERE filters on
//     adapter hops / extract edges / meta-node edges evaluate rootless
//     `property` reads against the hop's landed position, exactly as
//     the frozen engine evaluates `expressionFilter` at `r.position`;
//   - EXISTS() — the frozen engine's quantifier semantics mirrored:
//     walk the traversal from the subject position via the same read
//     seams (adapter `getRelated`, extract emission children, block
//     meta-node edges), true iff ≥1 yielded position satisfies the
//     WHERE (any position when absent).
//
// The settled-gap round after E8 mirrors the frozen engine's remaining
// expression families: `@<key>` meta values (time / acting-user / raw-
// actor keys, fed by `MovementMetaContext` — the same sources the frozen
// `resolveMetaKey` reads), array indexing (`[n]`, frozen semantics
// verbatim), and adapter field functions (bound per write field by the
// write path, exactly as the frozen field-mapping pipeline binds
// `fieldFunctions`). Deliberately retired (not pending): the inline KG
// query functions (KG_EXISTS / KG_VALUE) — the kg is an ordinary graph
// here, so query it by traversal (`kg-[c:company WHERE …]->`,
// `EXISTS(kg-[c:company WHERE …]->)`) like any other source. The
// TG-shaped `@parent.*` / `@resource.*` reads likewise have
// movement-native replacements (read the parent handle / traverse
// #resources).
