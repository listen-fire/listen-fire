// Movement engine — the KG-as-adapter seam (E3).
//
// The knowledge graph already speaks the Adapter contract
// (`translation_graph/adapters/knowledge_graph.ts`): consolidation's
// candidate search is its `resolveEntity` (including the kg_uniqueness
// adjacency search that powers edge-scoped compound identity), changeset
// application is `createRecord`/`updateRecord`
// (`knowledge_graph_writes.ts` — property + evidence rows in one
// transaction, parent-link edge wiring, mutation-event derivation at the
// commit boundary), and the team ontology is its own `listEntryPoints()` /
// `describe()` introspection like any other adapter's. The movement engine
// therefore resolves graph write targets through the SAME `resolveAdapter`
// seam as every other target — there is no special engine path, exactly as
// 6_engine.md prescribes.
//
// The engine-side correspondence GLUE that used to live here
// (`loadBridgeCandidates`, `bridgeToExternalForCreate`, `ensureKgBridge`) is
// RETIRED: correspondence is no longer an implicit KG bridge the engine
// asserts on every write. It is now a generic, engine-owned, symmetric
// BINDING declared in the language (`write … bind other`) and stored by
// `record_binding.ts` — the adapter is correspondence-agnostic. The KG
// adapter keeps `getPriorMatch` / `recordLink` and `linked_object` solely for
// the frozen TG engine (a parity harness), which still rides them; the live
// movement engine touches neither (explicit-linking, 3b).
//
// What remains HERE is the read-side `surfaceReadAdapter`, which is NOT
// KG-specific: it is the
// uniform natural-name read wrapper every source adapter rides. It carries NO
// name↔id translation (the adapter does that internally, Decision #3) — it
// only stamps each position's `recordType` with the hop target's NATURAL type
// (so the adapter can resolve the verbatim field/edge name) and preserves
// inline `data`. It lives here because the kg-seeded source was its first
// consumer, but it carries no KG knowledge.

// ── Source reads in the program's natural vocabulary ────────────────────────
//
// A movement reads its source positions through the SAME adapter read seam
// every source uses (`getFieldValue` / `getRelated`), and the PROGRAM speaks
// the adapter's NATURAL names (`m.\`From\``, `rec.\`Amount\``, `-[:\`Lead
// Investor\`]->`). The engine carries ZERO name↔id translation: it hands the
// natural field / edge / collection name straight to the adapter, which
// resolves it to its own internal id on the first line of `getFieldValue` /
// `getRelated` (Decision #3). This wrapper is therefore NOT a translator. It
// owns exactly two read-side concerns the adapter can't:
//
//   - STAMP each position's `recordType` with the hop target's NATURAL TYPE
//     NAME (resolved from the instance schema), so the adapter's own
//     `getFieldValue` knows which type to resolve the natural field against.
//     The raw event seed is often typeless (a webhook/email payload with
//     `recordType: null`); the movement parameter's declared natural type
//     (`startSurfaceType`) names it. A landed record is stamped with its hop
//     target's natural type.
//   - PRESERVE each position's inline `data` across the stamp — adapters that
//     carry record values inline (and the engine's bridge-to-external on the
//     iterated record) read it; re-stamping the natural type must not drop it.
//     (This inline-`data` preservation is a real bug fix kept from the prior
//     translating wrapper.)
//
// It is UNIFORM — the KG is not special. It lives here because the kg-seeded
// source was its first consumer, but it carries no KG knowledge.

/**
 * WHAT THE ADAPTER SAID THIS RECORD IS — its own stamp, where the schema
 * recognises the name as a position; `undefined` when it does not.
 *
 * The declared edge target is what the SCHEMA says a hop lands on; a walked
 * adapter often knows better, because the landing is polymorphic and it just
 * resolved which member it actually got (Affinity's `List Entries` declares the
 * collection `Organization List Entry`; the adapter lands the concrete `List
 * Entry — Pipeline`, which is the type that genuinely has `Deal Stage`).
 *
 * So the adapter's stamp WINS whenever the projected schema knows that name as
 * a position — it is a more specific answer to the same question, and the
 * schema knowing it is exactly the evidence that downstream reads can resolve
 * against it. Everything else is "the adapter told us nothing usable": the read
 * wrapper falls back to the declared target, and the member gate treats the
 * record as making no claim about which member it belongs to.
 *
 * ONE definition, because those two are the same question asked twice — the
 * wrapper decides what to STAMP a landing with and the gate decides what a
 * landing's stamp MEANS, and a gate that answered differently would compare a
 * name no record can ever carry (which is exactly how a narrowed `List Entries`
 * hop came to drop every record it landed).
