// Every MOVENG_UNSUPPORTED the engine can throw, and what stops a SAVED
// movement from reaching it.
//
// `unsupported(…)` fails a run at FIRE time. A movement that passed save and
// then fails in production for a construct the engine never ran is the worst
// place to find out — so each call site in the engine is registered here with
// its cover:
//
//   checker     — the movement-lang checker refuses every program that reaches it
//   dryRun      — the save-time construct scan (interpretable.ts) flags it; the
//                 snippet here PROVES the scan reaches it
//   harness     — only reachable when a durable seam is absent (a dry run or a
//                 test harness), never in a production firing
//   unreachable — nothing a program says can get there
//   partial     — the checker refuses the common case; `gap` says what slips by
//   uncovered   — a saved movement CAN reach it; `gap` says how
//
// A new `unsupported(…)` fails this test until it is registered, and the
// uncovered / partial count may only go DOWN: a new site must come with a
// checker diagnostic or a dry-run flag (or engine support instead of a throw).
// The sites are keyed by the construct text the engine throws, which is what
// a failed run shows.
