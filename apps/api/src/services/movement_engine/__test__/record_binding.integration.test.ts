// R1 (the explicit-linking correctness gate) — real-DB proof of the
// engine-owned binding store's dedup + self-heal semantics, the exact
// mechanism `executeBindWrite` (run.ts) rides:
//
//   1. RE-FIRE DEDUP — binding `other ↔ A`, then a second firing for the
//      same `other` finds the SAME counterpart A (so the bind flow takes the
//      update branch, not a second create): exactly one target.
//   2. SELF-HEAL — when the bound target is gone (the adapter reports
//      not-found), the bind flow deletes the stale binding and records a
//      fresh one to the re-minted record: one fresh binding, no stale row,
//      no duplicate.
//
// This runs the REAL `record_binding` SQL against the test Postgres (the
// `executeBindWrite` flow calls these same functions). It is the
// deterministic standing gate for R1; the dev-loop re-fire is the
// end-to-end complement.
