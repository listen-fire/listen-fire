/**
 * Run a function under a Context with no acting user — for background jobs
 * (poll workers, inline calls off a metering/webhook chokepoint) that need
 * SOME ambient context so `currentContext()`-reading services don't throw,
 * but aren't acting on behalf of any particular user.
 *
 * Safe to nest: AsyncLocalStorage.run() just shadows the outer store for the
 * duration of `fn` and restores it after, so calling this from code that may
 * or may not already be inside a context (e.g. an inline call off a movement
 * run) is harmless either way.
 *
 * It WRITES — notice markers, magic-link tokens, the outbound-email ledger —
 * and it has no identity to derive that from, so `systemWritable` says so
 * outright: the pool is chosen from the Principal and there isn't one here.
 * (That flag exists because the writable pool used to arrive as a SIDE EFFECT
 * of the public ability carrying MANAGE rules, which deleting the layer would
 * have silently turned read-only.)
