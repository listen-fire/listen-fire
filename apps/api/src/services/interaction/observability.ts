// NEVER touched (observability stays cheap). The team's open questions have their
// own new-store surface (ask_records.ts); what a run is "waiting on" here is its
// live `await` parks (an ask's Response, a Slack reply, …).

//   • listTeamRuns   → running + parked runs for the team, with what each waits on.
//   • listParkedRuns → every parked run, with the automation name, how long it's
//     been parked, and its await parks (P22 plain-language "waiting on" list).
//
// Team-scoping happens at the tRPC view; these take a `teamId` and filter on it.
