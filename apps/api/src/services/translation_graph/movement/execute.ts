// Movement firings on the movement engine.
//
// Movements execute from their CANONICAL TEXT through `runMovement`
// (services/movement_engine/run.ts), against the team catalog. The one
// consumer is `dispatchTriggerByIdEvent` (triggers/router.ts): every
// movement-derived trigger (trigger.movement_id set) fires through
// `runMovementFiring` — live events, kg mutations, cron ticks, and
// "Run now"'s manual-channel injections alike (run_now.ts dispatches
// through the router; there is no separate execution entry).
//
// Failure containment: engine errors record a FAILED trigger_run (never
// crash dispatch); a construct outside the engine's slice surfaces as
// MOVENG_UNSUPPORTED naming the construct. The save-time dry
// interpretability check (movement_engine/interpretable.ts) makes that a
// last line of defence, not the discovery mechanism.
