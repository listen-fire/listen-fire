// One adapter, three names an author may write.

// The name a program uses is resolved twice in this codebase — once by the

// catalog, when the checker asks whether a construction names anything at all.
// If those two ever disagree, `resend(…)` becomes a movement the checker calls
// clean while nothing about it was checked. So both are asserted here, side by
// side, against the same names.
