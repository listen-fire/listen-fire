// An `EdgeSchema`'s two promises are stored sparsely, and they default OPPOSITE
// ways: `readable` absent means readable (only a write-only edge opts out),
// while `writable` absent means READ-ONLY — the write promise is explicit, so
// silence is the safe answer, never an affirmative claim. That is ergonomic for
// adapter authors but leaves an agent reading a described instance to apply a
// rule it has to know. So at the describe boundary we fill the two booleans
// explicitly: the agent reads truth.
//
// Both answers come from the SAME predicates the checker's write gate and read
// traversal ask (`edgeIsWritable` / `edgeIsReadable`), because describe saying
// an edge is writable and the checker then refusing the write is the worst of
// the two failures: the authoring agent writes the movement, and only the run
// finds out. They cannot disagree if there is only one answer.
//
// This is a WIRE-level pass, deliberately kept off the shared projection: the
// `InstanceSchema` handed to `describeMovementInstance` is the SAME TTL-cached
// object the compile/checker path consumes, where absent-vs-present is
// load-bearing. So every level this touches is reconstructed — the cached
// input is never mutated.
