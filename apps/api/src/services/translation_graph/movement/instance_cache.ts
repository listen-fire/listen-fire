// Cached adapter-instance introspection for the movement catalog.
//
// Introspecting one (adapter, credential) pair — `listEntryPoints()` plus
// one `describe(typeId)` per entry — is the expensive, network-backed step
// of catalog assembly. Every consumer goes through this module:
//
//   - `movement.describeInstance` (tRPC) — the editor streaming schemas in
//     on demand as the source references constructions;
//   - `movementCatalogForTeam` — the saveMovement/provision compile path
//     introspecting only the pairs the source constructs.
//
// Semantics:
//   - in-memory TTL cache (3 minutes) keyed (teamId, adapterType, credentialsId);
//   - single-flight: concurrent callers for the same key share one
//     in-flight introspection;
//   - successes only — a failed introspection is evicted so the next
//     caller retries (a broken adapter shouldn't stay broken for the TTL);
//   - `forceRefresh` drops the entry first — `describeConnection` always
//     passes it, so it is the escape hatch when the external workspace's
//     schema just changed.
//
// E2 NOTE (runtime borrowed-type resolution): when the engine starts
// resolving borrowed instance types at run time, it should reuse this
// cache as its fast path but apply its OWN staleness rules (a run may pin
// the schema observed at compile time, or insist on fresher-than-TTL data
// for schema-sensitive writes). Keep run-time policy out of here; expose
// what it needs instead.
