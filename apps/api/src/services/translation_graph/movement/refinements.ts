// Position-aware narrowing, host side (2026-07-05; rebuilt on the walk
// 2026-07-16).
//
// The checker is position-aware purely in TYPE-space: a hop WHERE can rebind to
// a REFINED position type — an anonymous subtype carrying that position's actual
// surface (one spreadsheet's table edges, not the type's whole-collection
// union). The checker only LOOKS UP refinements (`InstanceSchema.refinements`);
// producing them is this module's job, run during catalog assembly where the
// program source, the projected schemas, and the live adapters are all in hand:
//
//   1. `scanInstanceChains` (movement-lang) yields every hop chain the
//      program walks from a constructed instance, filters as authored;
//   2. each chain is walked over the instance's PROJECTED schema in type
//      space — the same walk the checker will do — and every selection
//      resolves by EVALUATING its WHERE over the members the meta walk
//      published, then walking to the member it selected;
//   3. the resolved descriptor is projected (the standard descriptor→position
//      projection) and grafted into a COPY of the schema under a readable
//      synthetic name, keyed for the checker by `refinementKey`.
//
// NARROWING CONSUMES AN EXPRESSION THAT EVALUATES TO A BOOLEAN. That is what a
// WHERE already means at runtime, so there is ONE semantics here rather than a
// special author-time equality case beside it — and any predicate the shared
// filter unit can evaluate composes for free, conjunctions included. The
// checker decides nothing; it agrees with us on a key.
//
// A narrowed polymorphic edge is procedurally identical to a named one:
// `-[s:Spreadsheet WHERE `Title` == "Foo"]->` and `-[s:`Foo`]->` land on the
// same type node via the same minimal fanout, because the selected member NAMES
// its type and `describeType` walks one hop along a path the meta walk already
// handed over. That identity is why this module never asks an adapter to narrow
// on its behalf (the former `describeSelected`, which resolved the selector AND
// paid a fanout across every member to answer).
//
// Predicates that decide nothing, selectors that match nothing, and
// unresolvable hops all degrade to "no refinement" — the unnarrowed surface
// stays and the runtime guards remain the safety mechanism. The walk itself
// steps THROUGH refinements it just grafted, so nested selection composes.
