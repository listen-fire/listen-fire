// The walk, said in the agent's vocabulary.
//
// `edgesFrom` answers in the adapter's terms — field ids, type ids, flags whose
// absence carries meaning. This module turns ONE hop into the thing an agent
// reads: the node, its properties, and its edges, each edge carrying what it
// lands on. One shape at every depth; the root is just the node you get when
// you pass no position.
//
// Two rules shape everything here:
//
//   - **Truth, never a default the reader must know.** An edge's `writable` is
//     absent-means-no and its `readable` is absent-means-yes. That asymmetry is
//     ergonomic for adapter authors and a trap for anyone reading the result,
//     so both arrive resolved.
//   - **The caller echoes an address, never builds one.** Every edge hands back
//     the path that walks it, composed onto the path already walked. The string
//     that explores is the string an author writes in a movement.
