// Construction-site landing types, host side (2026-07-30).
//
// The refinements pre-pass next door resolves what a program's WHERE selects;
// this one resolves what a program's WRITE BODY decides. An edge may declare
// that its landing type is generic over one body field (`genericOver`) — an
// ask's `Response` over the `Options` that ask offered, so `Choose` with
// `["Seed","Series A"]` answers an enum of exactly those two, and `Provide`
// with `Answer Type: "number"` answers a number.
//
// Same skeleton, same reasons:
//
//   1. `scanInstanceChains` (movement-lang) yields every write's target chain
//      with its body as authored (`InstanceChain.writeBody`);
//   2. each chain is walked over the instance's PROJECTED schema in type space
//      to find the written type and the generic edge it declares;
//   3. the adapter turns the literals into a descriptor, which is projected the
//      standard way and grafted into a COPY of the schema, keyed for the checker
//      by `genericLandingKey`.
//
// THE TYPE IS ITS DERIVATION. The key is (base landing type, authored values),
// so two asks offering the same options share ONE synthesized position —
// collisions are structural identity, which is the point, not a hazard. The
// checker decides nothing; it agrees with us on a key.
//
// TYPE-SPACE ONLY. Nothing here reaches the engine: `resolveAwait` still matches
// landings by the family's base recordType, and the runtime answer values are
// already right (`coerceAnswer`). Threading the construction's literals into the
// ask record would be a second copy of a type nobody would read.
