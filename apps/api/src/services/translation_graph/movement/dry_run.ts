// The universal `dry_run` construction parameter — write run-mode
// derivation, pure AST (no catalog needed: `dry_run` is a platform
// argument, so construction + write-target shape is enough). Used twice:
//   - by `saveMovement`'s listener reconciliation, to derive each derived
//     trigger's dry_run⇄live run_mode from the text;
//   - by the run-now executor, to re-derive the dry-run flag from the
//     SAVED source at invocation time.
//
// Dry-run is movement-level (6_engine.md): the engine takes one dryRun
// switch per run, so the whole movement is 'dry_run' exactly when EVERY
// written-to instance was constructed `dry_run: true`. Mixed dry/live
// instances surface as 'mixed' with the offending write's span.
