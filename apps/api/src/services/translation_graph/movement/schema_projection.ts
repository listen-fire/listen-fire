// M5 — pure projections from the host's real schema sources into the
// movement checker's `InstanceSchema`:
//
//   - adapter introspection output (`listEntryPoints()` entries + one
//     `describe(typeId)` descriptor per entry) → per-instance schema,
//   - workspace credential rows → identifier-safe import names.
//
// Everything here is pure (type-only imports) so the unit suite exercises
// the mapping without a DB or the adapter registry's module graph. The
// I/O assembly lives in `catalog.ts:movementCatalogForTeam`.
//
// Name convention: the movement language identifies types, edges, fields
// and collections by the most NATURAL name the adapter provides — the
// adapter's `displayName` (types / fields) and reference `name` (edges),
// backtick-quoted when that name isn't a bare identifier. So the projection
// keys positions/collections/writableRoots/edges/properties by the NATURAL
// name (displayName), NOT the internal id (typeId / fieldId / ontology UUID).
// The internal ids the adapter's read/write calls consume are resolved INSIDE
// each adapter from the SAME introspection, by the adapter-layer
// `AdapterNameResolver` (adapters/name_resolution.ts) — uniform for every
// adapter, the KG included; the engine/host carries no translation. The
// projection here only produces the checker's `InstanceSchema`.
