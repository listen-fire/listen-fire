/**
 * The STORY VIEW — a `StoryIR` with its display vocabulary already resolved,
 * so the page that draws it never has to know a system exists.
 *
 * `storyOf` (movement-lang) is deliberately adapter-blind: it carries adapter
 * types, record types, event names and narrowing keys through as opaque
 * declared strings. Turning `attio` + `company` into "Creates a Company in
 * Attio" needs manifests, and manifests live here. So the join happens
 * server-side, once, and everything downstream — the record-graph diagram, the
 * step list — reads only what this file resolved.
 *
 * Two rules it inherits.
 *
 *   ADAPTER ENCAPSULATION. Every WORD of display comes from what an adapter
 *   declared: its manifest `displayName`, its `vocabulary.icon`, its
 *   `vocabulary.eventPhrase` templates, and the `displayName` its instance
 *   schema gives a record type. What this file adds is the composition
 *   ("<verb> <article> <record> in <system>"), which names nothing.
 *
 *   RENDER THE TRUTH. The view always carries the movement's validity, and
 *   unreadable source yields no view at all rather than a partial guess.
