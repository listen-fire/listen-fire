// Narrowing consumes an expression that evaluates to a Boolean.
//
// A WHERE already means "evaluate this predicate over these members" at
// runtime. Saying the same thing at author time gives ONE semantics instead of
// a special equality-against-a-literal case beside it — so any predicate the
// shared filter unit can evaluate composes for free (conjunctions, disjunction,
// negation, nesting), and there is nothing to widen when the language grows.
//
// This module is only the EVALUATION half. Who the members ARE is the caller's
// question, and it has two different answers on purpose:
//
//   - the direct walk (`instance_cache`'s `stepTo`) narrows over the members
//     THIS hop published — it holds them already, and a hop's own edges are
//     what a path step addresses;
//   - the refinement pre-pass narrows over the members the META WALK published
//     (`positionsByName`), because valid members are discovered by traversing
//     from the meta node — not from wherever the author happens to be standing.
//     That is what lets an EVENT's edge narrow to a table: the event never
//     enumerates the tables, the meta walk does.

 * The parts of `filter` THIS member can decide — a pushdown, and the same one
 * every filtering source performs.
 *
 * A WHERE is answered in two places: the member picks which node you are
 * standing on, and the rest runs over that node's rows. An AND is the one shape
 * where splitting it that way still answers the question asked
 * (`flattenAndConjuncts`), so the conjuncts are taken one at a time and an
 * OR / NOT stays whole.
 *
 * Two gates decide a conjunct, and they are why this can never over-claim:
 *
 *   - `isPurePredicate` — an `AI()`, a traversal or a function call can't be
 *     decided without the adapter/LLM/graph;
 *   - every leaf it reads must be present in the MEMBER'S OWN data. This is
 *     TIGHTER than purity, deliberately: `alias_ref` and `@current_date` are
 *     pure but are RUNTIME values, unknowable while typing.
 *
 * Dropping the undecidable rest is SOUND rather than a best effort: a
 * conjunction only ever selects a subset of what one of its conjuncts selects,
 * so the rows the hop yields are still that member's rows. This is what lets
 * `` `listName` == "Master Deals List" AND `Stage Order` >= cutoff `` narrow —
 * the list is named right there, and the cutoff is a runtime value that could
 * never have chosen a different list.
