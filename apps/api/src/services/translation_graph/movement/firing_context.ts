// A firing always runs as somebody, inside its team.
//
// Every way a movement fires off a REQUEST inherits that request's Context —
// tRPC and REST get one from the auth middleware, the WhatsApp door builds its
// own, the dev CLIs wrap explicitly. The BACKGROUND workers (the cron
// scheduler, the pollers, the two resume workers, the callback firer) call
// straight in with none, and the services that scope themselves by the ambient
// identity then throw. The one that hurt is text persistence: every page a
// plugin fetches is stored through it, the plugin's catch turns the throw into
// a warning, and a scheduled movement quietly fetched nothing on every run.
//
// So the Context is established HERE, at the seam every firing passes through,
// rather than in each worker — a seventh worker cannot forget it.
