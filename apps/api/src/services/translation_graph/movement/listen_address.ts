// The listen's RESOLVED ADDRESS — the position's path + the config's hops,
// names → ids, resolved by the walk at provisioning time.
//
// CHANNEL IDENTITY IS THE RESOLVED ADDRESS (plans/2026-07-10-adapter-entry-
// positions/8_event_edges.md, the leak-gate ruling). One rule answers
// three questions at once:
//
//   - WHERE the position's contribution to a subscription channel persists:
//     here, resolved once at provisioning and stored on the trigger row as a
//     DERIVED field (`trigger.resolved_address`), separate from the authored
//     `config` — authored and derived never share a bag;
//   - WHO resolves names → ids: the same walk the narrowing machinery already
//     does (`membersAt` over the adapter's declared `narrows` hops), so the
//     checker and the host derive one address and cannot drift;
//   - EQUIVALENCE across the transition: an old config-shaped row re-derives to
//     the same address (its config values ARE the ids), so
//     `canonicalAddress` keys old and new rows onto ONE channel — no
//     double-register, no churn, and vendor-unique table ids stop doing
//     identity's job by accident.
//
// A FAILED RESOLUTION IS A SAVE ERROR, never a silently-dead listen. The
// driven finding this kills: a half-scoped channel used to be minted ACTIVE
// with a null external id and zero notes (`b536a1a79`-adjacent measurement,
// 2026-07-17) — the registration silently impossible while the row claimed
// health. Provisioning now refuses to derive a trigger whose address doesn't
// resolve, and the reconciler refuses to mint a half-scoped channel
// (listen_subscriptions.ts), so that state is unrepresentable.
