// Event-address narrowing, host side — the positions a movement's SIGNATURE
// names, walked and grafted.
//
// A LISTEN IS SHORTHAND FOR A WHERE, and a SIGNATURE NAMES THE FULL ADDRESS.
// `movement intake(e: <at-[:`Record Created` WHERE `base` == "appDevLoop" AND
// `table` == "tblDeals"]->>)` declares the type it accepts; `listen to at {
// base: "appDevLoop", table: "tblDeals", … } fire intake` produces one. A listen
// whose address differs is a type error — the same rule as any call, where an
// argument must match a parameter. Nothing here is special to events.
//
// So this module grafts what the SIGNATURES name, not what the listens watch.
// The listens are checked against the result; they are not what brings it into
// being. That inversion is the fix for two MEASURED live bugs (`b536a1a79`):
//
//   - the retarget was keyed on the META TYPE (`edge.target !== from`), so once
//     listen 1 pointed `record` at Deals, listen 2 found no edge still on the
//     meta type and NO-OPPED. The first listen won and the second movement read
//     the first's table. Now each address gets its OWN copy of the event
//     variants, so there is no shared edge to win.
//   - the graft was keyed on the table's DISPLAY NAME, which is unique only
//     within a base, and `graftPosition` short-circuits on `if (positions[name]
//     !== undefined) return` — so two bases each with a `Deals` silently
//     DISCARDED the second descriptor. Now identity is `eventAddressKey`, an
//     opaque token over the whole address, and the display is a separate field
//     that is allowed to collide because nothing keys on it.
//
// Both bugs were one defect: a fabricated NAME doing an identity's job. Position
// -per-listen then falls out rather than being built — two addresses are two
// keys are two positions, exactly as `-[:Base WHERE `Name` == "CRM"]->` and
// `-[:Base WHERE `Name` == "Ops"]->` need no "per-base" mechanism.
//
// Three properties this file still exists to hold:
//
//   - THE ADDRESS IS A PATH, and the adapter declares it (`ListenConfigKey.
//     narrows`). Read as one hop, "narrowed by (base, table)" would have to know
//     the valid pairs — a `listTables` per base, the 1+N that started this plan.
//     As a path the base resolves first (1 call), then only that base's tables
//     (1 call). Never 1+N.
//   - IT IS THE SAME WALK A MOVEMENT DOES. `walkTo` is `walkPath` + `stepTo`,
//     the machinery the polymorphic-narrowing hop already runs; the WHERE is a
//     real `Expression` evaluated by the shared filter unit. No second walker,
//     no second semantics.
//   - IT DEGRADES TO SILENCE. An address that doesn't resolve grafts nothing,
//     the signature then resolves to no position, and the checker stays quiet —
//     never states something wrongly.
