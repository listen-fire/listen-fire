// The compile path's demand set (2026-07-05) — the second half of the
// position-aware pre-scan (the first half is refinements.ts).
//
// The program's text says exactly which types the compiler will inspect, so
// the compile path describes ONLY those instead of the adapter's full
// surface. Two pure pieces feed the loop in catalog.ts:
//
//   - `demandSeed`: the entries the program NAMES. Natural names are
//     authored verbatim (write roots, param shapes, collection hops, IS
//     tests, extract borrows), so a textual match over the sources is a
//     sound over-approximation — a false hit costs one spare describe, a
//     type the program never names is a type the checker never inspects by
//     name. Event-position entries are always demanded: listens, event
//     variants, and the projection's event heuristic need them regardless.
//
//   - `closeDemandOverChains`: the RECURSIVE CLOSURE along the program's
//     traversal paths — hop targets whose EDGE name differs from the type
//     name never appear textually, so each round walks the scanned chains
//     over the interim schema and demands every position they land on,
//     until a round adds nothing.
//
// Soundness rests on the projection + checker contract: projecting the FULL
// entry list with only the demanded descriptors keeps `collections`
// complete, and every undescribed position projects OPEN — which the
// checker treats as "surface not enumerated", staying silent rather than
// wrong. Anything the closure might miss degrades to silence.

 *
 * Worth knowing before it surprises you: this is ALSO what makes an Airtable
 * container walk reach the right base. A movement naming `` `CRM — Companies` ``
 * demands the base `CRM` too, because "CRM" is a substring of the table's
 * qualified name — so the checker walks meta → CRM → Companies without parsing
 * anything, and the base's hop teaches the path to the table. It is sound (the
 * false hit costs one spare BASE describe, one API call), but it works by
 * coincidence of the `"<Base> — <Table>"` naming convention rather than by
 * design: change the shape of that name and this silently stops reaching the
 * base, degrading the table hop to the full-workspace name lookup.
