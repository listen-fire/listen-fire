// Step timing for the authoring loop (validate → save).
//
// "Saving is slow" is only actionable if the answer says WHICH step spent the
// wall clock, so each call emits ONE structured line naming every step it ran
// — and the catalog step, the only network-backed one, carries what it paid
// for (introspection pairs, demand rounds, how many instances were already
// warm) so the line explains its own number.
//
// `otherMs` is the wall clock no step claimed: it stays honest only because
// `within` marks a sub-step of an enclosing step, and sub-steps are reported
// without being counted a second time.
