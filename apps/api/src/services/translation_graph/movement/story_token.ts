/**
 * The STORY LINK — a movement's picture, addressable by anyone holding the URL.
 *
 * The asks idiom, exactly: the token IS the authorisation, the route that
 * serves it is mounted before the auth middleware, and the page it opens
 * touches no credential. What it grants is deliberately narrow — a read of one
 * movement's story, projected fresh on every hit, and nothing else.
 *
 * One durable token per movement, minted the first time someone asks for the
 * link and reused ever after, so the link an agent hands out today is the link
 * it hands out tomorrow. No expiry: what the page shows is what the automation
 * currently does, which does not go stale on a clock. Revoking is explicit
 * (`revoked_at`), and deleting the automation takes the link with it.
