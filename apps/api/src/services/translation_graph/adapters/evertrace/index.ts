/** How many rows a paged fetch asks for at a time. */
const PAGE_SIZE = 100;

const EVERTRACE_HANDBOOK_CONTENT = `Evertrace watches public profiles and raises a **signal** when someone has just changed in a way worth knowing about — a new company, a stealth position, a departure, a new patent, grant or paper. Three surfaces: pull signals it has already found, react to new ones, and keep the saved searches and curated lists the workspace works from.

### signals — pulling what Evertrace already found

\`\`\`
since = DATE.ADD_DAYS(@current_date, -30)
evertrace-[s:Signals WHERE \`Score\` >= 8 AND \`Discovered At\` >= since]->
\`\`\`

There is no default time window: an unbounded walk covers the whole corpus, so give the WHERE a \`Discovered At\` lower bound and a \`Score\` floor.

Evertrace takes part of the WHERE itself and the rest is applied to what comes back, so the result is the same either way — only the amount fetched changes. What reaches Evertrace: \`Name\` (a partial match), \`Score\` (a floor), \`Country\`, \`City\`, \`Region\`, \`Gender\`, \`Age\`, \`Tags\`, and \`Source\`. \`Discovered At\` narrows what comes back. \`Age\` is a bucket over there — "Below 25", "25 to 29", through "Above 49". \`Tags\` carries two vocabularies: what the person is ("YC Alumni", "Big Tech experience", "Banking experience") and which event raised the signal ("New Company", "Stealth Position", "Left Position", "New Patent", "New Grant", "New Paper"). A WHERE naming values from one of them reaches Evertrace; one mixing both is applied to what comes back.

Below a signal, \`Experiences\` and \`Educations\` are the rows of the person's profile, each resolving one hop further to the \`Company\` or \`School\` Evertrace matched it to, when it matched one.

### listening — being told about new ones

\`\`\`
listen to evertrace { search: "Stealth in Europe", pollIntervalSeconds: 600 } fire triage
\`\`\`

A listener fires once per signal created since the last look. The FIRST look sets the mark and delivers nothing, so going live never replays the back catalogue — walk \`Signals\` when you want history. \`search\` names a saved search by its title or its id and narrows delivery to what that search matches; a date bound inside that search does not apply — the mark is what bounds delivery. \`pollIntervalSeconds\` overrides the five-minute default. A change to a signal that already exists does not fire — only a new one does. This is what a listener with no \`events\` delivers.

### listening — a signal added to a list

\`\`\`
listen to evertrace { events: ["list_entry"], list: "Pipeline" } fire file_it
\`\`\`

What arrives is the entry rather than the signal: \`Signal\` is the person, \`List\` is the list they went onto, and \`Added At\` is when. \`list\` names one list by its name or its id; leave it out and every list in the workspace delivers. The first look sets the mark and delivers nothing here too. Removing an entry and putting it back delivers again — that is a new entry.

### lists — filing a signal

A list owns its entries, so an entry lives under its list, and a signal's \`List Entries\` is that same membership seen from the other end. Both ends are required, so filing names them together:

\`\`\`
write (list-[:Entries]->, signal-[:List Entries]->) { }
\`\`\`

Adding is idempotent on the pair, so a repeat run never doubles a member. \`delete\` removes an entry. \`Lists\` and \`Searches\` are creatable, renameable and removable at the root; writing a search's \`Filters\` replaces the whole set rather than merging into it.

### lists — reading what is on one

\`\`\`
since = DATE.ADD_DAYS(@current_date, -7)
list-[e:Entries WHERE \`Added At\` >= since ORDER BY \`Added At\` DESC LIMIT 5]-> {
  …
}
\`\`\`

\`Added At\` is when the signal went onto the list, and it is the one thing Evertrace sorts entries by. Every other \`WHERE\` and \`ORDER BY\` runs over the list's entries once they arrive — the list is what bounds them, so an \`AI()\` or \`EXISTS()\` test is allowed here. A signal's \`List Entries\` reads the same memberships from the other end, and takes the same bracket.

Entries come back oldest first, so \`FIRST\`, \`LAST\` and a bare \`LIMIT\` read them with no \`ORDER BY\`:

\`\`\`
oldest = FIRST(list-[e:Entries]->)
Message: "Longest on the list: \${oldest-[s:Signal]->.\`Name\`}"
\`\`\`

A saved search's \`Signals\` takes the same bracket, and its own filters are what bound it — there is no order to lean on, so an \`ORDER BY\` says which one you mean.

### screening and viewing — facts about a signal

Marking a signal screened or viewed is a change to the signal itself, not a separate record:

\`\`\`
write signal { Screened: true }
\`\`\`

Evertrace has no un-view, so \`Viewed: false\` is refused; \`Screened: false\` does un-screen.

### what is deliberately not here

CSV exports, duplicating a saved search, screening and view counts, every signal sharing one LinkedIn profile, and the city lookup are each one endpoint away and not surfaced — say so rather than working around them.`;

/**
 * Static manifest. Polled source plus a real create/update/delete surface over
 * searches, lists and list memberships — so Evertrace is both a source and a
 * target. Nothing here is SUBSCRIBED to (there is no webhook): the event
 * vocabulary is the choice between the two things the poll can fetch, and the
 * `listen` options narrow each of them.
