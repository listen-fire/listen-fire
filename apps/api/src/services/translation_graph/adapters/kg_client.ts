// Structurally this is `native_valuations`' client, deliberately: a credential
// parsed out of `external_service_credentials`, a base URL that defaults to
// this instance, a fetch wrapper that names the operation in its failures. The
// one thing this client has that valuations does not is an ONTOLOGY CACHE —
// valuations describes itself with hardcoded constants, but a graph's model is
// per-team and user-editable, so `describe` is a live read and would otherwise
// be a round trip per type per walk.
//
// The wire currency is IDS (K-5). Names ride along for introspection and are
// never identity: a display name is renameable, and a persisted trigger routed
// by name would silently stop matching after a rename.
