  content: `## Platform events — when an automation fails (system)

Use \`system()\` to run an automation when something happens to your other automations. Post a failure to Slack:

\`\`\`
import { system, slack } from adapters
import { team_workspace } from credentials

sys  = system()
team = slack(credentials: team_workspace)

function \`Report Failure\`(failed: <sys-[:\`Run Failed\`]->>) {
  alerts = ONLY(team-[ch:Channels WHERE \`Name\` == "alerts"]->)
  if alerts == null { ERROR("no #alerts channel") }
  write alerts-[:Messages]-> {
    Message: "\${failed.\`Automation\`} failed: \${failed.\`Reason\`} \${failed.\`Url\`}"
  }
}

listen as "Report failures" to sys { events: ["Run Failed"] } fire \`Report Failure\`
\`\`\`

- Every event carries \`Automation\`, \`Automation Id\`, \`Run Id\`, \`Version\`, \`Reason\`, \`Url\` (a link to the automation's failed runs) and \`At\`.
- \`Run Failed\` arrives within a couple of minutes of a run ending failed, once per run. An automation is never told about its own failures, and a rehearsal failing is not reported.
- \`Validation Issue\`, \`Deprecated Version\` and \`Release Applied\` arrive when a new release is deployed. The first two fire once per automation that stays on an older language version (\`Version\` names it, \`Reason\` says what to repair); \`Release Applied\` fires once per workspace, with the release and its counts in \`Reason\` and \`Automation\` empty. Listen to them with \`events: ["Validation Issue"]\`, and so on.
- \`Run Paused\` arrives when a run reaches the deployment's cost limit and pauses instead of failing. \`Reason\` says what it spent and the limit, and \`Url\` links to the automation's runs. The run waits until someone resumes it, which resets its usage.
- Going live never replays earlier events: the first look sets the mark.`,
