Use \`cron()\` to run an automation on a schedule:

\`\`\`
timer = cron()

function \`Weekly Digest\`(t: <timer-[:Tick]->>) { … }

listen as "Weekly digest" to timer { schedule: "0 9 * * 1" } fire \`Weekly Digest\`
\`\`\`

- \`schedule\` (required): five-field cron — \`"0 9 * * 1"\` is 09:00 every Monday. UTC by default; add \`timezone: "Europe/London"\` (an IANA name, daylight-saving aware) for wall-clock time.
- The \`Tick\` carries \`Fired at\` and \`Schedule\`.
- Occurrences missed while the platform was down collapse into one tick — a digest that missed three Mondays sends one. A newly saved schedule waits for its next occurrence; it never fires retroactively.`,
