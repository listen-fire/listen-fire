// Adapter-layer natural-name → internal-id resolution.
//
// A movement program names every adapter/KG type, edge and field by the most
// NATURAL name the adapter can provide — the adapter's own `displayName`
// (types / fields) and reference `name` (edges), backtick-quoted when that
// name isn't a bare identifier (`kg.\`Funding Round\``, `crm.Companies`). The
// movement language prepends the adapter-instance identifier (`crm.`, `kg.`),
// so the adapter is unambiguous and the raw internal id (`attio:companies`, an
// ontology UUID) NEVER appears in program text.
//
// Naming is the ADAPTER's responsibility, NOT the host's. The Adapter
// INTERFACE trades in natural names; each adapter maps natural→its own backend
// id INTERNALLY, on the first line of each method, from its OWN cached
// introspection. The engine/host therefore contains ZERO id-translation.
// Only RECORD IDENTITY (`recordId` / `externalId` /
// `ExternalRecordRef.externalId`) stays an opaque id — it's a record key, not
// a name.
//
// This module is that translation, derived purely from the universal
// introspection every adapter already implements (`listEntryPoints()`
// displayName↔typeId, `describe(typeId)` field displayName↔fieldId + reference
// name↔fieldId/EdgeTypeId). The KG is NOT special — its `displayName` is the
// ontology node/property/edge name and its internal id is a UUID, resolved
// through this same path. A REMOTE adapter works identically: the shim builds
// the resolver from the introspection it already fetches over the wire.
//
// Two settled properties shape the contract:
//
//   - DRIFT ALWAYS THROWS (Decision #4). An adapter resolves a name against
//     EXACTLY the set its introspection exposes; a name that isn't there is
//     drift (the program was authored against a schema that has since changed)
//     and fails LOUD with a `MOVENG_RUNTIME`-style error. There is no
//     identity-passthrough branch and no "only throw if the surface is typed"
//     conditional — a `manual`/`cron` stub and every test fake must describe
//     what it exposes so its names resolve.
//
//   - NAME CLASHES ARE THE ADAPTER'S PROBLEM (Decision #5). The framework
//     defines no collision policy. An adapter is responsible for exposing an
//     unambiguous set; if it exposes two things with the same name the
//     consequence is the adapter's / the data model's (this resolver simply
//     keeps whichever it iterated last for that name — undefined behaviour we
//     don't paper over).

// `describe()` — one introspection per instance per process (instances are

// (its subclasses get `protected resolver()`); the KG adapter, which doesn't

/**
 * A memoizing resolver factory bound to one adapter's introspection
 * primitives. The adapter calls it on the first line of each interface method
 * to translate the natural names it receives into its own internal ids.
 *
 * SCOPED, and this is the whole point of the shape. `resolver({ types })`
 * describes exactly those types and nothing else; the descriptor map is an
 * accumulator, so repeated scoped calls build up whatever the run actually
 * touches and never more. `resolver()` bare describes NOTHING — it serves the
 * entries-only lookups (`typeId`, `naturalTypeName`, `collectionTypeId`),
 * which is most of them, at the cost of the entry list alone.
 *
 * It used to describe EVERY entry point on first resolve, regardless of what
 * was being written. That is a whole-graph load sitting on the write path: a
 * run that writes one Attio record paid an attribute fetch for every object in
 * the workspace. Nothing about resolving one name needed the other fifty.
 *
 * The returned resolver stays SYNCHRONOUS (bar `tryEdgeReadIdAnyType`, which
 * says why in its own doc). It closes over the live accumulator rather than a
 * snapshot, so one resolver object serves every call and simply knows more as
 * the run goes on — no call site changes shape, each just names its type.
