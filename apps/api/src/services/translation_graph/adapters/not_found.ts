// An `updateRecord` is a write BY id; when the target record is gone, the
// adapter must report it through the typed `UpdateNotFound` signal rather than
// throwing an opaque error, so the engine's bind self-heal can re-mint. Each
// adapter maps ITS OWN system's not-found into the signal — this module only
// supplies the common shapes (HTTP-404 detection, the signal constructor) so
// every adapter spells it the same way.
