// Knowledge-graph adapter — the graph as a system the engine reaches, on the
// same `Adapter` contract as every external one.
//
// It used to reach the graph by writing SQL against `knowledge.*` in this
// process. It does not any more: after D25 the graph is another optional
// system, so its READS go over HTTP to `/v1/knowledge/graph/*` with a stored
// credential, exactly as `native_valuations` does. What is left in here is what
// an adapter is FOR — translating the program's natural names into the wire's
// ids and back — rather than a privileged shortcut into somebody else's tables.
//
// Two consequences worth knowing before reading:
//
//   - **Every schema question is one cached ontology response.** Entry points,
//     `describe`, the name↔id maps and the dedup rules are all projections of
//     it, so a walk costs one round trip rather than one per type.
//   - **Ids are the wire currency, names are the program's** (K-5). The
//     translation happens on the first line of each method, and an ontology
//     UUID never rides a position.
