// Google Drive TG adapter — shared types + the name → structured-identifier
// cache. Drive's surface is the two nouns the API itself has (adapters/
// CLAUDE.md rule 4 — the old `document`/`upload` write forms were ONE
// concept, a File: `files.create` is the single creation endpoint; a Google
// Doc is a file created with the Doc mimeType and imported text):
//
//   • `folder` — a Drive folder: readable (granted roots + `Folders` edges)
//     and creatable ALONG A FOLDER'S EDGE (`write folder-[:Folders]->`).
//   • `file`   — a Drive file: readable (granted roots + `Files` edges,
//     bytes via the `File` field) and creatable along a folder's `Files`
//     edge — `File` uploads bytes, `Content` imports text as a Google Doc.
//
// Under the drive.file scope there is no root to write into: every create
// names a real parent folder, so creates live on the folder edges and the
// ROOT entries are read-only (rule 0 — access lives where access is real;
// the root collections are the credential's GRANTED items, and a parentless
// create would mint a record no root read could ever show again).
//
// A Drive write type is NOT parameterised by a target record id (a folder/
// file is CREATED, not addressed): the surface is a FIXED set of two kinds.
// The framework names each by its pretty `displayName` (`"Folder"`, `"File"`
// — rule 5: never the system name; the instance already says which system
// you're in) — that IS the `typeId`/`recordType` every entry and position
// carries — and the write/describe logic recovers the `kind` it routes on
// from that name via `structuredIdFor`. There is deliberately NO
// `encode/decodeTypeId` magic-string codec: the kind is never flattened into
// a string and crammed onto a position. Because the kind set is compile-time
// fixed (no introspection), the "cache" is a plain reverse map
// (Listen-Fire-Valuations style), not a fetched one.
