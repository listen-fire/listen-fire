// Dropbox TG adapter — shared types + the name → structured-identifier cache.
// Dropbox's surface is the two nouns the API itself has (adapters/CLAUDE.md
// rule 4 — the old `document`/`upload` write forms were ONE concept, a File:
// `files/upload` is the single file-creation endpoint and "create a text
// document" is just an upload of text/plain bytes):
//
//   • `folder` — a Dropbox folder: readable (root collection + `folders`
//     edges) and creatable (root or along a folder's `folders` edge).
//   • `file`   — a Dropbox file: readable (root collection + `files` edges,
//     bytes via the `File` field) and creatable (root or along a folder's
//     `files` edge; the `File` field carries the bytes — a File-typed value
//     or inline text).
//
// A Dropbox record is addressed by PATH (not id): the externalId of a created
// record is its path, the display URL is `dropboxWebUrl(path)`, and the
// linked_object externalId is a path. The Dropbox ROOT is itself a real
// folder (path ""), so the root collections are that folder's children and a
// root create lands there.
//
// A Dropbox write type is NOT parameterised by a target record id (a folder/
// file is CREATED, not addressed): the writable surface is a FIXED set of two
// kinds. The framework names each by its pretty `displayName` (`"Folder"`,
// `"File"` — rule 5: never the system name; the instance already says which
// system you're in) — that IS the `typeId`/`recordType` every entry and
// position carries — and the write/describe logic recovers the `kind` it
// routes on from that name via `structuredIdFor`. There is deliberately NO
// `encode/decodeTypeId` magic-string codec: the kind is never flattened into
// a string and crammed onto a position. The kind set is compile-time fixed,
// so the "cache" is a plain reverse map (Listen-Fire-Valuations style), not a
// fetched one.
