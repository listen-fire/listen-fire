// One hop of the walk, built two ways.
//
// Every adapter answers the same question — "what is here, what leaves it, and
// what would I land on" — but they do not all answer it the same way. An
// adapter with CONTAINERS (Airtable's bases, Sheets' spreadsheets) has to walk
// them itself: which containers exist, and how each is addressed, is not
// derivable from anything. An adapter without containers has nothing to walk;
// its type ids already locate every node in its meta graph.
//
// So this module offers the two shapes:
//
//   - `hydrateTargets` — the LOOKAHEAD alone, for an adapter that builds its
//     own hops. The one mechanical part of the contract, and the reason it is
//     separable: what an edge says about its target is a fact about the
//     descriptor, never about how you got there.
//   - `uniformWalk` — the whole walk, for an adapter with no containers.
//
// Both exist so the answer to "what does an edge tell you about its target"
// has ONE implementation. Layer 2 requires that scaling the lookahead back to
// a stub be an edit in one place rather than sixteen; that promise is only
// true if sixteen adapters do not each hand-roll it.

 * stops being one position's frontier and becomes the whole graph.
 *
 * It returns the stub rather than a boolean because a stub still has to NAME
 * its target usefully, and only the adapter knows the natural name — a
 * framework building one from `targetTypeId` alone would put `email:message`
 * in front of an agent that should be reading `Email`. Return undefined to
