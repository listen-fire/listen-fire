// THE Response WRITE, and the doors over it (callback-primitive layer 3).
//
// Answering a request is an ORDINARY EDGE WRITE — `write a-[:Response]-> {
// Answer: TRUE }` — so the answer semantics (coerce against the family, single
// answer, closed-request-wins) live in ONE function, `writeAskResponse`, and
// every caller is a wrapper over it:
//   • the ask adapter    — `createRecord` along `-[:Response]->`, i.e. any
//                          movement code, including a callback body
//   • the link page      — a confirmed POST on `/api/asks/<token>`
//   • Slack / Telegram   — a block-action / callback-query POST
//   • the agent (MCP)    — an answer against an ask id
//   • the control tower  — an operator answering on a person's behalf
// One semantics, several callers. The engine is never involved — a settle just
// hands the record to this deployment's `AskSettledNotifier` (composed: the
// in-process nudge that wakes a parked run promptly, with the poll as the
// backstop; standalone: a signed webhook to whoever asked). Either way it is a
// courtesy on top of an answer that is already durable.
//
// GET never writes ANYWHERE: this door is only ever reached from a POST /
// block-action / authed call. A `?answer=` query param PRE-FILLS a control; it
// never resolves.
//
// Ops decisions
