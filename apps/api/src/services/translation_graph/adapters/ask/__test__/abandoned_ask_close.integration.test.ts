// An ask whose asker walked away is CLOSED, against a real DB.
//
// The gap this stands over: a park could be withdrawn — a race arm that lost to
// a timer, a run stranded by a retired listener, a run that failed — while the
// ask that park was awaiting stayed `open`. Its link kept rendering a live
// answer form, accepted a submission, and told the person "The workflow will
// continue shortly", which was false: the run had already settled. Nothing was
// left to consume the answer.
//
// So every path that drops parks without their answer now runs the ONE closing
// routine (`abandonAskAwaits`), and the link renders the already-closed page
// instead. The three legs below are the three ways a park is dropped, plus the
// case that must NOT change: an ask answered before the settle keeps its answer.
