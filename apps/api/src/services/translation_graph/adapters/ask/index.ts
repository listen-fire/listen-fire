// The ask adapter — asks-as-adapter, layer 3B. An ORDINARY adapter that happens
// to hold the awaitable capability; its entire specialness is its record
// semantics. It replaces the old `ask` LANGUAGE STATEMENT: instead of a bespoke
// checker/interpreter path, an author constructs `ask()` like any adapter and
// writes a question along a family edge —
//
//   asks = ask()
//   write asks-[:Check]-> { Prompt: "Ship it?" }
//
// Positions = FAMILIES (`Check`, `Provide`, `Choose`, `Select`, `Review`,
// `Correct`, `Draft`, `Form`). The family fixes the answer's type (the surface
// control and the stored answer can never disagree — the founding incident,
// structurally gone). Each written record
// exposes the author's immutable fields, a readable `Url` (the ONLY delivery
// affordance — the adapter renders nothing, sends nothing), a readable `State`,
// and a write-only `Cancelled` surface (the ordinary position-write update form
// `write a { Cancelled: true }`) that freezes the record to `expired`.
//
// The `Response` edge is an ORDINARY edge that happens to be AWAITABLE: readable
// and writable SYNCHRONOUSLY, with `await` demoted to "the read that waits"
// (callback-primitive layer 3). Writing it — `write a-[:Response]-> { Answer:
// TRUE }` — is how an answer arrives from anywhere, a callback body included,
// and the answer semantics (coerce against the family, single answer,
// closed-request-wins) are enforced AT that write, in `answer_door.ts`. Reading
// it yields nothing until the request is answered. No root readability in v1
// (AGREED, ruling 2026-07-28): asks are pure one-shots, so the families are
// writable-but-not-readable — a program cannot enumerate open asks.
//
// Credential-free, team-scoped intrinsic (like `manual` / `cron`); the record
// store lives in `store.ts`.
