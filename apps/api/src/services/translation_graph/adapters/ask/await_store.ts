// The ask adapter's slice of the GENERIC correlation map (`adapter_await`, rows

// (`await_correlation.ts`); what is ask-SPECIFIC and lives here is RESOLVABILITY:
// an ask await resolves when its ask record SETTLES (answered / expired), which
// the resume worker discovers by joining the correlation rows to `ask.state`.
// (Slack, by contrast, is event-driven and needs no such poll.) Correlation, NOT
// stability — the ask id IS the identity, stored as the row's `correlation_key`.

 * correlation alone (the older behaviour) left the ask `open`: its link kept
 * rendering a live answer form, took a submission, and told the person "the
 * workflow will continue shortly" — a promise nothing was left to keep. An ask
 * whose asker is gone is closed, so the link renders the already-closed page and
 * a late submission is refused instead of falsely accepted.
 *
 * Order matters: the correlation goes FIRST. `loadResolvableAskAwaits` treats a
 * settled ask as a resolvable leaf, so closing the ask while its correlation
 * still stands would hand the resume worker the very park we are withdrawing.
 *
 * An ask that raced us to `answered` (the race WINNER, whose answer is what
 * settled the frame) stays answered — `cancelAsk`'s `WHERE state = 'open'` guard
 * makes that a no-op, which is why this is safe to call over a whole subtree.
