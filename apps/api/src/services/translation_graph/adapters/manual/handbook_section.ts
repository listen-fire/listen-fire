Use \`manual()\` to let a person — or an agent — start a run by hand. "Run now", pasted text, and uploaded files all arrive as its \`Invocation\` event:

\`\`\`
runs = manual()
crm  = attio(credentials: acme_main)

function \`Import Companies\`(go: <runs-[:Invocation]->>) {
  found = extract from [go.\`Text\`, go-[:Files]->.\`File\`] {
    node company: "each company named in the supplied text or files" {
      name:   "the company's name"
      domain: "the company's web domain, if given"
    }
  }

  found-[c:company]-> {
    write crm-[:Companies]-> {
      unique by (FUZZY \`Name\`)
      Name:    c.name
      Domains: c.domain
    }
  }
}

listen as "Import companies" to runs {} fire \`Import Companies\`
\`\`\`

- The example is the whole pattern: whatever the person supplied — \`go.\`Text\`\`, uploaded \`Files\` — goes into the extraction's \`from [ … ]\`, and the writes fan out from what was found.
- Only \`Fired at\` is always present; \`Text\`, \`Run by (email)\` / \`(name)\`, and the \`Files\` edge are optional — a bare run has empty text and zero files. A \`File\` position carries \`Name\`, \`Content Type\`, \`Size\`, and the file itself.
- A backfill is this same channel with the source read in the body: \`crm-[c:Companies]-> { … }\` runs the block once per existing record. The parameter stays the \`Invocation\`.`,
