// Base class for TG adapters — provides sensible defaults so new adapters
// only have to override the methods that actually differ from the common
// case. Three rough categories of defaults:
//
//   • Identity resolution → linked-object bridge match on `record.id`.
//     This is what most external adapters want; the engine pre-filters
//     candidates by adapterType + recordType, so all that's left is
//     matching the inbound record's id against `candidate.external_id`.
//
//   • Field-level reads → scalar lookup on the position's data payload
//     (`positionData(position)[fieldId]`). New adapters that cache their
//     record payload on the position get scalar reads for free; override
//     for adapters with computed/aliased fields or nested-envelope
//     payloads.
//
//   • Writes (create/update/delete) → throw a uniform
//     "not implemented" error. Source-only adapters inherit this and
//     get a clean diagnostic if anything ever tries to route writes
//     through them; target-capable adapters override.
//
// ── THE ONE RULE every adapter follows (name ↔ structured-identifier) ──
// A position's `recordType` is the pretty TYPE NAME (the `displayName`) — the
// only type currency the framework, the engine, and other adapters ever see.
// Your own routing identifier (an object slug, a `{ baseId, tableId }`, a kind
// enum, a node-type UUID — whatever your API actually needs) is PRIVATE: it
// lives only in a per-adapter `name → identifier` cache (built from your own
// introspection, or read off the event/record when only the payload exposes
// it), and you resolve the name → identifier on the first line of each method.
// NEVER stamp your identifier onto a position you emit, and never encode it into
// a magic string. A position that carries a raw identifier is a leak — it drifts
// loudly at the resolver boundary, by design, so the bug is caught immediately
// rather than silently tolerated. (See `airtable/` for the introspected-id
// reference, `native_valuations.ts` for the fixed-set variant, and
// `plans/2026-06-29-typeid-displayname-duality/1_name_to_identifier_cache.md`.)
//
// The KG adapter is intentionally NOT built on this base — its source
// positions are `kg-node`/`kg-edge` rather than `external-record`, and
// its identity model is constraint-driven, not bridge-driven. Anything
// derived from `BaseAdapter` is, by convention, an external-system
// adapter.
