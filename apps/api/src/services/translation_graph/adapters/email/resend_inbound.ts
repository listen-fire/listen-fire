// The Resend inbound door, and what it takes to turn a Resend delivery into
// the same email every other part of the system already understands.
//
// Resend's webhook is a notification, not a message: `email.received` carries
// ids and an envelope and nothing an author can read. So this file does two
// things the Mailgun path never had to — believe a Svix signature over the
// exact bytes that arrived, and then go and FETCH the message.
//
// What it deliberately does not do is decide anything about routing. Whose
// team the mail is for and which trigger answers for it are the same three
// questions Mailgun's door asks, and they are asked in the same place
// (`routeInboundEmail`), because a message routing differently depending on
// who carried it would be a bug nobody would find.
