// Which mail provider this deployment's email runs through.
//
// A movement author never picks one: the fields, the edges and the attachments
// are the same whichever company carried the message. The provider decides
// three deployment-level things — the door mail arrives at, how attachment
// bytes are reached, and which API sends outbound mail — so it is resolved
// once, at boot, from what is configured.
//
// Resend wins when both are configured. Not because it is better, but because
// a deployment must have exactly ONE answer to "where does mail come in": two
// live inbound doors on one address means the same message arriving twice, and
// a rule that says "whichever" is a rule that says "sometimes both".
//
// Attachment bytes are the one place the boot answer is NOT the right one. A
// handle stored last week names the provider that stored it, and a deployment
// that has just switched providers still has to be able to redeem it — so
// bytes are served by the provider the HANDLE names, not by the configured
// one. Silent 401s on old attachments is exactly what the old
// `endsWith('mailgun.net')` special-case produced when anything else appeared.
