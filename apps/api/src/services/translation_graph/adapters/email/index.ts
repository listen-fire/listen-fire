// Email adapter — implements the translation-graph Adapter contract for
// inbound email as a source. Email is source-only in this build:
// `writeResource` throws because there is no email target system that
// accepts resource persistence. Body and attachments are reached
// explicitly — body via the `Text` field, files via the `-[:Attachments]->`
// edge — the retired input-side `#resources` bundle is gone.
//
// Position payload shape: `external-record` with `recordType === 'email'`
// and `data` matching `EmailPayload` below — mirrors the inbound
// payload shape produced by the Mailgun / custom-email handlers
// (apps/api/src/adapters/pipeline/inbound), but is *not* imported from
// them per the R4b brief ("Mirror; don't import"). Keeping the type
// local lets the TG-side contract evolve independently from the
// pre-existing webhook adapters.
