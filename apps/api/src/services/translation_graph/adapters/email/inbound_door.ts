// The inbound email door: what a Mailgun POST has to get past before anything
// downstream treats it as an event, and which team it belongs to when it does.
//
// It lives beside the email adapter because it is the same channel seen from
// the outside: the adapter owns the payload contract and the actor candidates,
// the door owns admission and routing. Its previous home was
// `adapters/pipeline/inbound/mailgun.adapter.ts` — a dealflow file — where the
// live door's auth logic sat inside a deletion set (carve M-41, ST-14/D31).
//
// Three questions, in order (carve D32):
//
//   1. Is it really Mailgun?     HMAC(apiKey, timestamp + token) === signature.
//   2. Whose team is this?       The SENDER's. External senders are refused —
//                                a `<local>+<key>@` address is a user-chosen
//                                slug, guessable by anyone, so the recipient
//                                cannot be the thing that authorises a metered
//                                run.
//   3. Which team, if several?   The routing key is unique only WITHIN a team,
//                                so a sender who belongs to more than one team
//                                is disambiguated by which team owns a trigger
//                                for that key. Two owners = ambiguous = dropped.
//
// The sender is resolved through two sources, mirroring what the columns it
// replaced did: the Directory answers for login addresses (core-owned identity,
// reached through the one deliberate global lookup, `teamsForEmail`), and
// `inbound_email_route` answers for SERVICE addresses — shared inboxes and
// forwarding proxies that are not anybody's login, plus the opt-in that lets a
// `+tag` on one of them still resolve.
//
// Steps 2 and 3 are about the MESSAGE, not about who carried it, so they are
// split out (`routeInboundEmail`) and shared: a Resend delivery, whose wire
// shape and signature scheme are entirely different, routes through the same
// three questions once its own door has believed it.
