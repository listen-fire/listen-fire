const DEALROOM_HANDBOOK_CONTENT = `Dealroom is a database of **companies**, **investors**, **people** and **funding rounds**, with the links between them. It is read-only: look something up by name or domain, walk out to what it is connected to, and react to new rounds.

### looking something up

\`\`\`
company = FIRST(dealroom-[c:Companies WHERE \`Website URL\` = "acme.com"]->)
\`\`\`

A domain is the surest way to land on one company; a \`Name\` equality is an exact-name search and \`contains\` is a fuzzy one. Dealroom takes part of the WHERE itself and the rest is applied to what comes back, so the result is the same either way — only the amount fetched changes. What reaches Dealroom on \`Companies\`: \`Name\`, \`Website URL\`, \`Industries\`, \`Tags\`, \`Growth Stage\`, \`Company Status\`, \`HQ City\`, \`HQ Country\`, \`Total Funding\` and \`Launch Year\` bounds, and lower bounds on \`Last Updated\` and \`Created At\`. \`Investors\` takes \`Name\`, \`Investor Type\`, \`Investment Stages\`, \`Industry Experience\` and the HQ location; \`People\` takes \`Name\`, \`Gender\`, \`Backgrounds\`, the HQ location and the founder-strength flags; \`Funding Rounds\` takes \`Round\`, \`Date\` bounds, \`Amount\` bounds and \`Is Verified\`.

An \`ORDER BY\` on \`Name\`, \`Total Funding\`, \`Last Updated\` or \`Created At\` reaches Dealroom's own sort, so \`LIMIT 5\` is one page rather than a scan. An unbounded walk stops at Dealroom's 10,000-result ceiling with an error rather than a short answer — narrow it or bound it.

### walking out from a company

\`\`\`
company-[r:Funding Rounds]-> { … }
company-[i:Investors]-> { … }
company-[t:Team WHERE \`Is Founder\` = true]-> { … }
\`\`\`

Each of these is the FULL list from its own endpoint, not the five that ride the company record. \`Similar Companies\` is Dealroom's own "companies like this one".

\`Team\` lands on a membership rather than the person: \`Titles\`, \`Is Founder\`, \`Is Executive\`, \`Is Partner\`, \`Past\`, \`Start Year\` and \`End Year\` are facts about the pair. \`Person\` from there is the full profile, and costs a fetch.

An investor walks to \`Investments\`, \`Funding Rounds\`, \`Co-Investors\`, \`Funds\` and \`Team\` the same way. A person walks to \`Companies\` — that one rides the person's own record, so it costs nothing and carries the summary fields rather than the full company.

### rounds

A round's \`Company\` is who raised. Its \`Investors\` are participations, not investors: \`Lead\` is a fact about the pair, and \`Investor\` from one is the full record. \`Unknown Investors\` are names Dealroom has no record for, so they are NOT on \`Investors\`.

\`Date\` is the round's year and month as a date — Dealroom records no day, so every round in a month reads as the first of it.

### listening — a new round

\`\`\`
listen to dealroom { rounds: ["SERIES A"], hq_locations: ["Europe"] } fire triage
\`\`\`

A listener fires once per round Dealroom RECORDED since the last look. The FIRST look sets the mark and delivers nothing, so going live never replays the back catalogue — walk \`Funding Rounds\` when you want history. \`rounds\`, \`industries\` and \`hq_locations\` narrow delivery; \`pollIntervalSeconds\` overrides the ten-minute default. A round that is corrected afterwards does not fire again: recording is the only "new since" Dealroom offers.

### what is deliberately not here

Universities and alumni, news feeds, traffic and social analytics, the bulk and dump exports, the filter catalogues, the location lookup, the removed-entity and GDPR logs, and the "tell Dealroom about a company it is missing" endpoint are each one endpoint away and not surfaced — say so rather than working around them. Nothing is writable: Dealroom is a database you read.`;

/**
 * Static manifest. A polled source with no write surface at all — Dealroom's
 * only mutating endpoint asks their team to research a company it is missing,
 * which is a support request rather than a record write.
