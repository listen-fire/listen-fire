// Affinity TG adapter — shared types, the entity structured identifier, the
// credential parser, and the Affinity value-type constants the adapter consumes.
//
// A TG type is one of Affinity's writable entities: organization, person,
// list-entry, note, file. The framework names every type by its pretty
// `displayName` (`Organization`, `List Entry — <list>`); the adapter's private
// `name → structured identifier` cache maps that name to the `DecodedTypeId`
// (`{ entity, listId? }`) its read/write logic routes on. The five fixed
// entities resolve PURELY (their names are compile-time constants), so they
// resolve before any introspected per-list cache (mirrors Attio's synthetic
// meta types). The richer per-list form (`{ entity: 'list-entry', listId }`)
// pins a single list while still resolving back to the generic `list-entry`
// schema; only the per-list names carry a listId the live catalog knows.
//
// Affinity has a v3 OUTPUT only (no v3 input), so the TG adapter is a write
// target plus the reads that support it — parity = the target side.
