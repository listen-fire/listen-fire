// The Gmail type graph: the entry surface and every type descriptor.
//
// Rule 0 (adapters/CLAUDE.md): the shape follows the NATURAL graph, not the
// API. A mailbox holds MESSAGES, and a message holds FILES — that is the whole
// of it. Gmail's threads are not a node here: a thread carries no facts of its
// own beyond its messages, and the thread id on the message is everything a
// reply needs (rule 1). Labels are a field on the message rather than a type,
// because this connector can read them and can never set one.
//
// Everything here is STATIC — no credential, no network — so `describe` is free
// and the walk hydrates every target rather than stubbing.
