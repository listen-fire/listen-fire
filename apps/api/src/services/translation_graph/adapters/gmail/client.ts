/**
 * Construct a client for a team's connected mailbox. Returns null when no
 * credential is wired, when the row belongs to the RETIRED per-user sign-in
 * (`app_id` says so without anything being decrypted), or when the stored
 * payload doesn't parse for the shape that column names — the caller turns that
 * into a clear "connect Gmail" error, which is a better diagnostic than an
 * authentication failure.
 *
 * The shape comes from `app_id` rather than from sniffing the payload: a row
 * whose column and contents disagree is a row nothing should act on.
 *
 * THROWS, rather than returning null, when the credential is real but its
 * mailbox is not (or no longer) allowed here — a credential connected under a
 * wider list must stop working the moment the list narrows, and the run's trace
 * should say why, not just that Gmail needs reconnecting.
