// Ownership gating for inbound events — the §6.4b rule: on a gated adapter,
// an inbound event is processed only when its actor resolves to a
// REGISTERED team user. One rule covers both hazards: the bot's own reply
// re-ingested (never a registered user → drops → no self-loop) and an
// unregistered person addressing the bot (drops — accepted implication:
// listeners never fire on messages from externals/guests).
//
// The resolver runs WITHOUT trigger context, deliberately: resolveActingUser's
// creator override and fallbackToCreatorIfActorUnregistered authenticate an
// UNRESOLVED actor as the trigger creator — attribution conveniences that
// would let the bot's own echo pass an ownership gate. They keep governing
// run-time `@user_*` attribution only.
//
// Fail CLOSED: no candidates, no match, or a resolution error all drop —
// failing open reopens the loop this gate exists to kill. The dispatcher
// marks the stored receipt suppressed, so nothing is lost: a wrongly-dropped
// event is visible and replayable.
