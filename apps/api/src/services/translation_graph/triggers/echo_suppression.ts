// Opt-in echo-suppression — the inbound consult for the `suppress_self` listen
// flag.
//
// THIS IS NOT A LOOP DETECTOR. It is a declarative 2-WAY-SYNC feature, DEFAULT
// OFF. An author who builds an A↔B sync (one movement that both reads and
// writes the same system) sets `suppress_self: true` on the listen to mean
// "ignore my own writes echoing back into this system," so the sync doesn't
// self-trigger. Off matters: a user legitimately WANTS to react to Listen-Fire's own
// writes (Movement 1 writes a company to Attio → Movement 2 posts new Attio
// companies to Slack); a default-on suppression would nuke that.
//
// The consult is capability-gated. It asks the SOURCE adapter
// `didWeAuthor(event)` — the adapter answers from what IT owns (the change's
// actor and/or a short-TTL memory of our recent writes). The scope is the
// authorship of THIS change, never the record's identity-forever: a human's
// later edit of a record we once wrote answers `false` and fires normally.
//
// When the flag is on but the adapter can't answer (doesn't implement
// `didWeAuthor`, or returns `null`), this is a clearly-logged NO-OP — the
// author asked for something this source can't do, and we never silently
// swallow a legitimate event on an indeterminate answer. The floor (Phase 1)
// and the opt-in nature already bound the cost of an un-suppressed echo.
