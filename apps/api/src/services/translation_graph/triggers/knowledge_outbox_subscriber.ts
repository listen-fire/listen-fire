// The composed deployment's end of knowledge's outbox.
//
// A graph mutation now reaches a movement listener exactly one way: knowledge
// commits an outbox row, its drainer picks the row up, and delivery happens.
// In the composed Listen-Fire container that delivery is this function call rather
// than a socket round trip to ourselves — but it is the SAME delivery, after
// the same durable hop, which is why chained graph movements behave the same
// here as in a split deployment (M-38). Nothing subscribes to graph writes
// in-process any more.
//
// The direction matters as much as the mechanism: knowledge knows nothing about
// movements. This module reaches into knowledge's registration hook, not the
// other way round, so a standalone knowledge deployment simply has no local
// subscriber and its consumers register webhooks.
