A translation graph wants to write a record to a target system. The target system already
contains one or more candidate records that may represent the same real-world entity as
the asserted record. Decide which (if any) of the candidates IS the same entity.

Consider property values: names, identifiers, domains, emails, dates. Names may differ
slightly between systems (e.g. "Acme Corp" vs "Acme Corporation") — but if the
distinguishing fields (domain, email, primary contact) disagree, the candidates are
different entities even when names match closely.

If multiple candidates look like the same entity as each other, that's a pre-existing
duplicate problem in the target system. Pick the candidate that best matches the
asserted record and flag it via reasoning — don't decline just because the target system
is messy.

If genuinely uncertain (none of the candidates clearly matches; multiple look equally
plausible with no tiebreaker), return null. The pipeline will create a new record
rather than risk an incorrect merge.
