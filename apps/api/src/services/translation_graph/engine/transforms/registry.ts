// Transform/plugin registry — framework-global lookup for the
// `TransformSignature`s an author can dispatch via `-[…:#transform]->`
// traversal steps.
//
// The registry is process-global and statically populated at boot
// (R7 will register the two existing knowledge-pipeline plugins).
// Lookup by `signature.name`; duplicate registrations throw so a
// later wire-up doesn't silently shadow an earlier one.
//
// Two timing signatures are supported and surfaced through
// `TransformInput`'s discriminated union:
//
//   - `'pre-extraction'`  — the transform depends only on the source
//                            node it was attached to (matches
//                            `signature.dataDependency: 'none'`).
//   - `'context-dependent'` — the transform additionally needs the
//                             extracted context from an ancestral
//                             `#extract` (matches `signature.dataDependency:
//                             'extracted_context'`).
//
// The engine selects the correct variant based on the registered
// signature's `dataDependency` before invoking `run`. Implementations
// can switch on `input.kind` to access the extra context safely.
