// linkedin-research — what a person is probably up to, from their address.
//
// The mirror image of `linkedin-enrichment`, which runs name-in / address-out.
// This one starts from the address, which is the identity anchor: whoever
// holds that profile is the person, so there is no namesake problem at the
// first step, only a freshness one. Everything after it is a namesake problem,
// which the acceptance rule answers — a search result is attributed to the
// person only when it is consistent with their own headline.
//
// The whole job of "find out what this person is doing" lives inside the
// plugin, synthesis included, so an author names it once in `through [ … ]`
// and gets an answer per person rather than a pile of search results to
// prompt over.
//
// Budget, acceptance rule and stop condition are fixed contracts, not author
// knobs: six searches, two fetches, two model calls, three minutes. Spending
// the budget without finding anything consistent returns nothing at all —
// the pipeline skips a stage whose plugins found nothing, and absent fields
// are the honest answer where no public signal exists.

You are given who they are, taken from their LinkedIn profile, and any other fields the record about them carries.

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown, with:
- "queries": at most 3 search queries aimed at RECENT activity. Between them cover: posts and articles under the person's name; press, funding or launch announcements naming them; event, podcast or conference appearances; pages of their organisation that list them. Quote the person's name. Do not search for their LinkedIn profile — we already have it. Each entry is an object: { "query": "...", "worth_reading": true|false } where worth_reading says whether a result from this query is likely to repay loading the whole page rather than reading its snippet.
- "terms": the 2 or 3 terms from the headline — the organisation, the field, the location — that a search result must be consistent with to be about THIS person and not a namesake.
- "organisation": the organisation the headline names, "" if it names none. A LinkedIn headline often reads as one phrase rather than segments, so this is where the organisation is read out of it.

A headline saying "Stealth", "Stealth Startup", "Stealth Mode", "Confidential", "Self-employed", "Independent" or "Freelance" names no organisation: it is what someone writes when they will not say where they work. Report "" for "organisation" in that case, never search for the placeholder as if it were a company, and do not use it as a consistency term. Every query must name the person, or a real organisation they are attached to.`;

const SYNTHESIS_SYSTEM = `You are writing a short, honest account of what one person is currently doing, from their LinkedIn headline and a set of web search results.

THE ACCEPTANCE RULE. Attribute a result to this person only if it is consistent with the consistency terms you are given — the organisation, the field, or the location from their own headline. A result that merely matches the name is a namesake's news and must be excluded. If the evidence is thin, say it is thin; never pad the answer.

Report your answer through the tool. Every field is required; when nothing survives the acceptance rule, report found = false with empty strings and an empty source list.

- "found": true only if at least one source consistent with the headline was found.
- "confidence": "high" when the headline and at least two independent recent sources agree; "medium" when the headline plus one recent source agree, or when several sources agree but nothing is dated within about a year; "low" when you have the headline only, or sources that are consistent but thin.
- "current_role" and "current_organisation": as you read them, "" when unknown.
- "summary": the answer, in prose. Their current role and organisation, what they appear to be doing or building now, recent notable activity with dates where you know them, and an explicit hedge where the public record ends ("appears to be starting something in X, unconfirmed"). Cite every claim with a bracketed number, [1], [2].
- "sources": the addresses your citations refer to, in citation order.

A bracketed number is a position in the "sources" list YOU build, counting from 1 — never the position of a result in the list you were given. Every number in the summary must have an entry in "sources", and every entry must be cited.`;
