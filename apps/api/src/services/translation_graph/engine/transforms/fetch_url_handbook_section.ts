export const FETCH_URL_HANDBOOK_SECTION: HandbookSection = {
  title: 'Fetch a page — the link a record carries',
  content: `## Fetch a page — the link a record carries

\`fetch_url\` loads the one link you give it and returns the page's text — absent when the load failed or the page was empty.

### the-shape

\`\`\`
import { fetch_url } from plugins

detailed = MAP(companies, (c) => {
  page = fetch_url(url: c.website)
  return extractOne([...content, TEXT.SERIALISE(c, 'JSON'), COALESCE(page, "")], CompanyDetail)
})
\`\`\`

Called inside the \`MAP\`, each company loads its own page, and only that company's extraction reads it. Two companies in one message get two pages. \`COALESCE\` the result before it goes into content.

### when-the-field-is-empty

An empty \`url\` loads nothing: the call is absent, with no error, and is skipped for that record alone. A message naming three companies of which one has no address still produces three records — two enriched, one not.

A LinkedIn address is read as a profile: a person's profile comes back as their profile, and any other LinkedIn address — a company page, a post — comes back empty rather than as the page LinkedIn shows a stranger.

### gated-links

A shared document often arrives with its own way in written beside it: "here's the deck — docsend.com/view/abc, password SUMMER24". Extract the way in like any other field and pass it:

\`\`\`
node Opportunity: "each opportunity this message is about" {
  company:       <text> "the company's name"
  deck_url:      <text> "the link to the deck, if the message has one"
  deck_password: <text> "the passcode for that link, if the message gives one"
}

MAP(extract([m.\`Body\`], Opportunity), (o) => {
  deck = fetch_url(url: o.deck_url, email: @user_email, password: o.deck_password)
  …
})
\`\`\`

\`email\` and \`password\` are typed into a link that demands them before it will show its content. A link with no gate ignores both, and without them a gated link comes back empty rather than being guessed at.

Access that arrives INSIDE the content — a passcode someone wrote in a message — is data, and belongs in these arguments. The keys and tokens that let the workspace reach a connected system are held by the connection and never written in source.

### scan-or-load

\`fetch_url\` loads one link, named. \`vc_url_retrieval\` reads a whole piece of text, works out which of its links are worth loading, and loads all of them. Reach for this one when a record carries the address, called once per record; reach for the other when the message does.

### Common mistakes

- **Expecting two pages from one call.** It loads one. Several links in a record's own text is what scanning is for.
- **Putting the page in content raw.** It may be absent; \`COALESCE(page, "")\` first.
