// fetch-url — the targeted half of URL retrieval.
//
// `vc-url-retrieval` reads a whole message and decides for itself what is
// worth fetching. This one fetches exactly the link it is given, so a stage
// behind a record's fields loads THAT record's page and nothing else. The
// two are separate surfaces on purpose: a scan whose target is optional and
// a load whose target is required are different contracts, and one plugin
// carrying both would have to guess which one the author meant.
//
// The per-URL fetch itself is shared with the scanning plugin
// (`./fetch_resource`) — the gated-document path, the profile path, and the
// plain scrape are the same work once something has chosen a URL.

/**
 * `params.url` is required and author-supplied. It is normally a field an
 * earlier stage extracted (`fetch_url(url: website)`), which is what makes a
 * per-record stage load a per-record page. A required argument that resolves
 * absent skips the invocation at the stage boundary (see
 * `movement_engine/extraction.ts`), so a record whose website came back empty
 * simply gets no enrichment — this implementation never sees a blank url.
 *
 * `params.email` / `params.password` are the credentials a gated link
 * (DocSend, a data room, …) demands before it will show its content. They
 * reach only the gated-document path; a plain web page and a profile page
 * ignore both.
