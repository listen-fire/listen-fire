// The agentic engine: one turn, Anthropic's own web tools, the guardrails in
// the prompt.
//
// The constrained engine spends a model call planning queries and another
// confirming a candidate, and everything between them is code deciding what to
// look at next. This engine hands that loop to the model: it searches and
// reads pages server-side, inside one request, and comes back with an answer
// and a record of everything it looked at. What code still owns is the two
// things a prompt cannot enforce — the anchor gate runs before the call, so a
// bare name never spends anything, and the budget is a hard `max_uses` on each
// tool rather than an instruction.
//
// What moves into the prompt is the acceptance rule, the preference for a
// subject's own domain over a directory that lists everybody, the rule that a
// famous namesake is not a match, and the rule that a wrong website is worse
// than none. They are written as refusals, because the failure they prevent is
// a confident wrong answer rather than a missing one.
//
// One host is not the model's to decide about. Anthropic's server fetcher
// refuses linkedin.com outright, so a turn handed a profile address is blind
// to the page that anchors identity — and, told to read the addresses it was
// given, wastes a read discovering that. The profile is therefore read HERE,
// with the constrained engine's own primitives and caps, and handed into the
// prompt as material the turn already has. This engine is agentic about the
// web, not about LinkedIn.
//
// The answer is shaped by a second, small forced-tool call rather than by
// asking this one for JSON: a turn that has just read four pages is the worst
// possible place to also demand well-formed output.

// It is four searches and three reads, which is what the engine has always

// their answers — one burned its three searches, asked for four more, took
// `max_uses_exceeded` on every one and answered nothing — while the mean wall
// clock did not move. The tail was never the tool COUNT. It was that each
// page entered the context whole and the server-side loop re-read every page
// it had opened on every later iteration, which is what the content cap in
// `web_tools.ts` now bounds.

const RESEARCH_SYSTEM = `You are researching one subject — a company or a person — and writing a short, honest dossier about it.

You have web search and a page reader. Use them; do not answer from memory. You may read a page only if its address is already in front of you: one the message gave you, or one a search returned — never a guessed or constructed address, a likely homepage or company URL you were never actually handed. A guessed address is not read; it fails.

You cannot open linkedin.com. The page reader refuses that host outright, so do not try: an attempt spends a read and returns nothing. Where the message carried a profile address it has ALREADY been read for you, and what was read appears below under "THE PROFILE, AS READ". That address anchors identity — whoever holds that profile is the subject — so nothing is attributed to the person unless it is consistent with that profile's own headline.

WHAT TO LOOK FOR, IN THIS ORDER
1. The subject's OWN page: their website, or the profile whose address you were given.
2. Recent, dated coverage that names them.
3. Everything else, which is context rather than evidence.

STOP AS SOON AS YOU CAN ANSWER
Answer the moment the questions are answered: a page that has already answered them is not a reason to open a second one, and an allowance you have not spent is not a budget to use up. A page that will not open is not opened again — say nothing about it and move on.

THE RULES YOU MUST NOT BREAK
- A source that merely matches the name is a namesake's. Accept it only if it is consistent with what you were told about the subject — the sector, the location, the people, and where the subject is a person, their own headline. Nothing is attributed to a person unless it is consistent with their own headline.
- A famous company, product, standard or framework that shares the name is NOT the subject. The subject is one a message has just noticed.
- Prefer the subject's own domain to a directory, an app store, an encyclopaedia, a jobs board or a news aggregator. Those say the name exists, which was never in doubt.
- A WRONG website is worse than none. If you are not confident a site belongs to this subject, report no website at all.
- Refuse honestly. If nothing consistent turns up, say so. Never pad an answer, and never present a plausible guess as a finding.

WHAT TO WRITE
Answer the questions you were asked and stop. Cite every claim with the address it came from. Then, under a heading "DOSSIER", quote the passages that bear on those questions, each under its source address — the quotes themselves, not a second summary, so a later reader can find a detail your answer did not anticipate. Keep the whole thing to a few paragraphs.

Write as if the caller never doubted who this is: never mention searching, which sources you kept or excluded, or that the identity checks out. Put any doubt about identity in CONFIDENCE, not in the prose.

The FIRST SENTENCE says what the subject does. Not that they match what you were told, not that the identification is consistent, not which of several candidates this is. And never close on what you could or could not retrieve — a page that would not open, an address you could not read: that is what CONFIDENCE is for, and it belongs nowhere in the prose.

End with three lines exactly:
WEBSITE: <the subject's own site, or "none">
LINKEDIN: <the profile address, or "none">
CONFIDENCE: <high | medium | low>`;

/** `found`, `answers_everything`, `confidence` and `summary` are load-bearing
 *  — there is nothing to file without them. `dossier` and `sources` are not
 *  (see `contract.ts` — the quirk this guards against is shared with the
 *  constrained engine's own synthesis call). */
const shapeSchema = z.object({
  found: z.boolean(),
  answers_everything: z.boolean(),
  confidence: z.enum(['high', 'medium', 'low']),
  summary: z.string(),
  dossier: dossierField,
  sources: sourcesField,
  website: z.string(),
  linkedin: z.string(),
});

const SHAPE_SYSTEM = `You are filing a research write-up into fixed fields. The write-up is already done; do not research anything, add anything, or soften anything.

- "found": false when the write-up says nothing consistent was found.
- "answers_everything": true only when every question the caller asked is answered in the write-up.
- "confidence", "website", "linkedin": as the write-up's own last three lines state them. "none" means an empty string.
- "summary": the write-up's answer, without the dossier and without the three trailing lines. If the write-up narrates its own verification — sources kept or excluded, identity checking out — drop that framing and keep only the answers. Drop an opening sentence that announces the identification ("this matches strongly", "the subject best matching X is") and a closing note about what could or could not be retrieved: the summary starts with what the subject does.
- "dossier": the quoted passages under their source addresses, as written.
- "sources": every address the write-up cites, in the order it first cites them.`;
