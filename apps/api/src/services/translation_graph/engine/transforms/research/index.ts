// research — what does this person or company do?
//
// One plugin for the whole question. An entry carries whatever it carries — a
// name, a line of text, a website, a profile address — and the caller says
// what it wants to find out; the plugin works out which of those is which and
// returns a dossier sized to the question.
//
// It replaces the three plugins an author previously had to choose between and
// wire so they stood down for each other. A link is an input now, not a reason
// to do nothing.
//
// The gate that costs nothing sits HERE rather than in either engine: an entry
// with no address and nothing distinctive said about it is refused before any
// engine is asked, so a bare name in a message costs the same nothing whichever
// engine is running. Every other decision belongs to the engine.
