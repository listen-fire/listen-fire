// The constrained engine: every decision about what to look at is in code.
//
// It routes on what the entry actually carries, because the three things an
// entry can be are three different identity problems:
//
//   - A LINKEDIN ADDRESS is an identity anchor. Whoever holds that profile is
//     the person, so the only question is freshness, and everything found
//     afterwards is accepted only where it is consistent with their own
//     headline.
//   - A WEBSITE is the subject's own words. There is nothing to confirm; it is
//     read through the shared fetch, which is HTML-only and capped.
//   - A BARE NAME is the hard case and the common one. A name alone returns
//     the world, so nothing is searched without a distinctive term from the
//     context, no result counts on a name match alone, and a model confirms
//     the candidate before the address is trusted. A WRONG website is worse
//     than none: it poisons every field extracted after it.
//
// Whatever routes ran, they end in ONE synthesis call sized to the caller's
// questions. The routes gather evidence; the synthesis is where the answer is
// written, so an entry that arrived with a profile AND a name gets one dossier
// rather than two half-answers.

- "queries": at most three web searches that would surface the subject's own pages and recent news about it. Every query must contain the name AND at least one distinctive word from the context (a city, a sector, a product, a person). A query that is only the name searches for the word, not for the subject.
- "anchors": the distinctive words FROM THE CONTEXT you relied on, each written exactly as it appears there. A word you did not take from the context is not an anchor.

A context saying "Stealth", "Stealth Startup", "Confidential", "Self-employed", "Independent" or "Freelance" names nothing: it is what someone writes when they will not say. Never anchor on one.

- "confidence": "high" only if the candidate's content matches the context — the same business, the same sector, and where the context names a place or a person, no contradiction. "medium" if it is plausibly them but the page says nothing that confirms it. "low" otherwise.

A different subject with the same name is the failure to avoid, and it is common: names are reused across countries and sectors. When the evidence only says "this name exists", the answer is null.

Two more nulls, both of which look like matches:
- a page belonging to a large established company, product, standard or framework that happens to share the name — the subject described is one a message has just noticed, not a household name;

THE ACCEPTANCE RULE. Attribute a source to this subject only if it is consistent with the consistency terms you are given — the organisation, the sector, the location. A source that merely matches the name is a namesake's and must be excluded. Where the subject is a person and their own headline is given, nothing is attributed to them that contradicts it. A famous namesake is not a match.

SIZE IT TO THE QUESTIONS. You are told what the caller wants to know. Answer that and stop. A dossier for "what does it do and which sector" is a few paragraphs, not a page dump.

ANSWER, DON'T NARRATE. Write the summary as if the caller never doubted who this is: never mention searching, which sources were accepted or excluded, or that the identity checks out. Any doubt about identity belongs in confidence, not in the prose.

THE FIRST SENTENCE SAYS WHAT THE SUBJECT DOES. Not that a source matches, not that the identification is consistent, not which of several candidates this is. And never close on what could or could not be retrieved — a page that would not open, an address that could not be read: that is what confidence is for, and it belongs nowhere in the prose.

Report through the tool. Every field is required; when nothing survives the acceptance rule, report found = false with empty strings and an empty source list.

- "found": true only if at least one source consistent with the subject was found.
- "answers_everything": true only if the questions asked are all answered. False when some are and some are not.
- "confidence": "high" when the subject's own page, or two independent sources that agree, support the answer; "medium" when it is plausible and unconfirmed; "low" when the material is thin.
- "summary": the answer, in prose, sized to the questions. Cite every claim with a bracketed number, [1], [2].
- "dossier": the content itself — the excerpts and snippets that bear on the questions, each under its source address, so a later stage can read a detail this summary did not anticipate. Quote; do not paraphrase into a second summary.
- "sources": the addresses your citations refer to, in citation order.

A bracketed number is a position in the "sources" list YOU build, counting from 1 — never the position of a source in the list you were given. Every number in the summary must have an entry in "sources".`;
