// Reading the person behind a profile address — the one page neither engine
// can simply open.
//
// A profile address anchors identity: whoever holds it IS the person, so
// everything found afterwards is accepted only where it agrees with their own
// headline. But linkedin.com is closed. The shared scraper meets a login
// wall, and Anthropic's server fetcher refuses the host outright
// (`url_not_allowed`), so an engine that hands its loop to the model is blind
// to exactly the address that would settle who it is researching.
//
// So both engines read the profile the same way, in code, before they
// research anything: the search index first, because a profile's index entry
// carries the name, the headline and often the organisation; the profile
// service only when the index came back with nothing to check a later result
// against, because it is slow and paid for.
//
// One reading, shared — two readings would attribute the same page to two
// different people.
