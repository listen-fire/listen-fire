// web-research — the entry that arrived with nothing but a name.
//
// Most of a deal-flow message is links: a website to fetch, a profile to
// research. The rest is a name and a line of traction text, and every
// retrieval plugin skips it, so the stage behind them sees the same one line
// the stage before it read. This plugin is what those entries go through: it
// resolves the name to the company's own homepage, fetches it, and hands back
// the address plus the page, in the shape `fetch-url` hands back a page, so
// the next stage folds it the same way.
//
// It stands down rather than duplicating work: an entry that already carries a
// website or a profile address is somebody else's job, and this one returns
// immediately without a model call or a search.
//
// A WRONG website is worse than none — it poisons the description, the deep
// dive and whatever the run writes into a CRM domain field — so the gates are
// deliberately severe:
//
//   1. No search without an anchor. A bare short name is a word, not a
//      company, and searching for it returns the world. A query has to name
//      the company AND something the context said about it (a location, a
//      sector, a founder). No anchor in the context, no search — that entry
//      stays unenriched, which is the correct answer rather than a failure.
//   2. No candidate on a name match alone. Aggregators and app stores name
//      everybody; only the company's own site is worth having, and a model
//      confirms it against the context before it counts. Anything short of a
//      confident match emits nothing.
//   3. Two queries, one fetch. These entries are two thirds of a run, so
//      every cost here multiplies.

A different company with the same name is the failure to avoid, and it is common: names are reused across countries and sectors. When the evidence only says "this name exists", the answer is null.

Two more nulls, both of which look like matches:
- a page belonging to a large established company, product, standard or framework that happens to share the name — the company described is one a message has just noticed, not a household name;
- a page ABOUT the company rather than BY it: an article, a directory entry, a review, a jobs board, a list it appears on.`;
