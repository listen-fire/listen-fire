// Dry-run adapter wrapper. Wraps a real target Adapter so writes are
// intercepted before they reach the external system, while reads still
// hit live data — the same "simulate the write, observe what would
// happen" shape v3 uses via output_v3/adapters/dry_run.ts.
//
// In dry-run mode the engine still:
//   • resolves entity matches against the real target (so we see whether
//     a record would be matched vs. created),
//   • reads current values for no-op detection (skips that would skip
//     for real),
//   • drives `applyActionPlan` to its normal endpoint so applied plans
//     and diagnostics line up with what a live run would record.
//
// What it doesn't do:
//   • write to external systems (create/update/delete return synthesized
//     results without side effects),
//   • emit RecordMutationEvents (no downstream cascade),
//   • insert linked_object bridges (the engine gates `ensureBridge` on
//     `ctx.dryRun`).
