// server-side; a REMOTE adapter can't ride raw bytes over the JSON wire. For
// those, the consuming adapter pulls the FileRef's bytes (`streamFileRef`) and
// calls `exposeFile` — this deployment buffers them to S3 under an isolated
// temp prefix, records the handle in `exposed_file`, and hands back a
// deployment-domain URL. The public `GET /api/files/blob/:id` route
// (interfaces/rest/files.ts) 302-redirects that to a presigned S3 URL scoped
// to the prefix. S3 stays an implementation detail — this deployment is the
// party both ends already trust, so it exposes the URL.
//
// Lazy-at-write: only called for files actually written to a URL-needing target,
// never by the engine on every write. A periodic poller (services/exposed_file)
// deletes expired rows + their S3 objects.
