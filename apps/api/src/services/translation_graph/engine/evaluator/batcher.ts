// Batcher interface — the contract R1 (this evaluator) calls and R2
// implements. The evaluator owns site-identification, scope capture, and
// schema synthesis; the batcher owns the actual LLM batching, prompt
// assembly, and result distribution.
//
// Why the split:
//   - The evaluator can resolve everything statically about a site
//     except the LLM result (siteId, description, data set, scope,
//     output schema).
//   - The batcher is the only piece that needs the LLM client, prompt
//     templating, and result re-binding. Keeping it behind an interface
//     means unit tests for the evaluator can use a deterministic stub
//     batcher with canned answers.
