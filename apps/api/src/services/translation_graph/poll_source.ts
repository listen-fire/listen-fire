// The PollSource seam — solicited, schedule-driven event production.
//
// Polling a source on a schedule for new/changed events is NOT a core adapter
// concern (the `Adapter` interface is about reading and writing records), so it
// lives here, on its own interface. A package MAY implement both `Adapter` and
// `PollSource` — Granola does — sharing the same underlying API client; the two
// are distinct seams, resolved through distinct registries.
//
// The platform half is `services/poll_source/worker.ts`: it scans trigger rows
// whose `kind` resolves to a registered PollSource, calls `getEvents` with the
// persisted opaque checkpoint, and injects each returned event into the SAME
// dispatch path a webhook uses (the one event pipeline). A remote adapter that
// needs to poll does so internally and delivers via its webhook — the framework
// never drives a remote PollSource over the wire.
