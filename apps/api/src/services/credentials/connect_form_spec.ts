// Author-time connect-LINK key-entry form spec.
//
// The connect link works for OAuth adapters (browser sign-in) AND API-key
// adapters (a browser form where the user pastes — or replaces — the key). For
// the key-entry kind, the landing route renders a form whose FIELDS come from
// here, and the submit route validates the posted values with the SAME zod
// parser the in-app `addCredential` mutation uses (views/credentials.ts).
// One field spec per credential type, paired with its real parser, so the form
// is never hardcoded per adapter and can never drift from what the adapter
// actually accepts.
//
// Only adapters whose credential is a user-supplied key/secret belong here.
// Intrinsic credentials (NATIVE_VALUATIONS — server auto-mints; connected via
// intrinsic_provision.ts) and handshake credentials (TELEGRAM — deep-link /
// shared-bot) are deliberately absent: they have no "paste a key" browser form.
