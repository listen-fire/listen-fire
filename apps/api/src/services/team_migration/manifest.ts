/**
 * What a tenant IS, table by table.
 *
 * The database already knows two of the three things a per-team migration
 * needs: which tables exist, and which table must be written before which
 * (the foreign-key graph). It is read for both — see `catalog.ts` — so nothing
 * here restates a fact Postgres can be asked for. Ordering in particular is
 * DERIVED, never declared, which is why adding a table to a unit schema cannot
 * silently leave this file's ordering stale.
 *
 * What Postgres cannot know is the third thing: which rows belong to a team.
 * `team_id` answers it for most tables and nothing answers it for some, so that
 * — and only that — is what this file declares. Every table in the five unit
 * schemas appears below exactly once; `catalog.ts` refuses to run if one is
 * missing, so a new table cannot join a schema without someone deciding what
 * it means to a tenant.
