/**
 * Is this team already here?
 *
 * The answer decides between two behaviours and the choice is deliberate: a
 * second import REFUSES rather than merging or duplicating. Merging would need
 * a per-table conflict rule that nothing in the data can supply — a row whose
 * id matches but whose contents differ is either an edit made on the target or
 * a stale export, and only a person knows which. Duplicating would breach the
 * unique constraints on half these tables and silently double the rest.
 * Refusing is the only answer that cannot be wrong, and re-running after a
 * `delete-team --confirm` is the supported way to redo an import.
