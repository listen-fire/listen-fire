// WhatsApp dumb dispatcher — the agent-free inbound path. An inbound Meta
// message is routed, with NO agent in the middle, to an ingestion path the
// sender's team has wired:
//   1. a movement `trigger` of kind INBOUND_WHATSAPP (preferred), else
//   2. a legacy `pipeline_input` (default_for INBOUND_WHATSAPP), else
//   3. dropped (logged).
// Modelled on `inboundEmailHandler` (interfaces/rest/private.ts) — trigger-first,
// pipeline_input fallback.
//
// The RECEIVING number gates which of those paths is even eligible
// (`resolveWhatsappRoute`): once a movements number is configured, the
// movements number reaches movements only (never the legacy pipeline) and the
// primary number reaches the legacy pipeline only (never movements). Before a
// movements number exists the single number keeps the trigger-first→legacy
// fallback for both.
