// W3-A2 — Per-test cleanup helpers.
//
// Pattern: tests create a fresh team and use `teamId`-scoped writes
// throughout. After each test, this helper truncates every row that
// references the team across both `public` and `knowledge` schemas.
//
// Deletes are issued in FK-respecting order. The set of tables comes
// from manual inspection of the wave-1 golden-path's write surface —
// extend as the harness grows. Tables not listed here will leak rows
// across tests if they're written and not cleaned.
//
// Trade-off: this is more brittle than the alternative of dropping +
// re-applying the schema between tests (~5s per test) or wrapping each
// test in a Postgres transaction with rollback (subtle pooling
// interactions with Kysely). The brief's recommendation was a
// dedicated test DB + per-team cleanup; this implements that.
