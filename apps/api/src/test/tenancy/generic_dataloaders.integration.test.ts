// The two-team probe for the three GENERIC dataloaders (D44d).
//
// `findByIdDataloader`, `findByUniqueDataloader` and `findManyByFkDataloader`
// carry no scoping of their own: every `ModelService.getById` in the codebase
// funnels through them, and each is handed nothing but a model name and a key.
// Whatever filter they applied used to be whatever the CLIENT they ran on
// applied — which is why this was the one place deleting CASL could silently
// open cross-tenant reads. `TENANT_SCOPES` answers that now, per model, in
// writing, and this asks the question directly against real rows in a real
// database: acting as a member of team A, which of team B's rows comes back?
//
// While the ability layer stood, this ran in two states — under a real user's
// abilities, and again with the ability opened all the way up so the declared
// filter was the only one left — and the two had to agree. They did, which was
// the evidence that these loaders' tenancy never depended on CASL. That second
// state is gone because it arrived; the expectations are unchanged from the
// two-state form, so the runs stay comparable across the deletion.
//
// The expectations below are DESCRIPTIVE, not aspirational: they record what
// the system does, including where that is wider than one would like. Where a
// model is knowingly unscoped the test says so and why, so the next reader does
// not mistake a recorded fact for an endorsement.
